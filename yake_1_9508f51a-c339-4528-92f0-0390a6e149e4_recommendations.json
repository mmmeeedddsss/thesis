Over his long and prolific career, he's proven himself to be one of the last authentic voices in pure country music. In fact, in the spirit of the music's outlaw lineage, Dale has disavowed himself of the country label and begun calling his music Ameripolitan. However it might be described, on his latest album, From The Cradle To The Grave, it's the music that speaks the loudest. Marking his HYENA Records debut, Dale offers ten new songs that range from the epic Justice For All to the achingly beautiful ballad, It's Not Over Now. And if it sounds like Johnny Cash's presence is looming over the recordings, that's because it was. The album was recorded in Cash's old Tennessee Mountain cabin that was lent to Dale by its current owner Johnny Knoxville. With that in mind, Dale embraced the Cash aura and in the process turned out one of his best albums to date in an already impressive discography.\",\"Though Dale Watson has long been a torchbearer for classic country, a throwback to the sounds of the 1960s and '70s, never before has he channeled so much inspiration from the late Johnny Cash. Recorded in Cash's cabin (since bought by Watson's actor buddy Johnny Knoxville), the songs really heavily on Cash's signature \\\"boom-chicka-boom\\\" rhythm, and the arrangements occasionally employ the sort of mariachi brass that evokes \\\"Ring of Fire.\\\" Themes of life and death permeate the material. The title cut could have been a Cash outtake, while the \\\"Runaway Train\\\" finale pays him explicit tribute. Elsewhere, Watson changes pace by injecting some Waylon Jennings into \\\"You Always Get What You Always Got,\\\" and lightening things up with \\\"Hollywood Hillbilly.\\\" Watson's baritone and band are in fine form throughout. <i>--Don McLeese<\\/i>\"],\"title\":\"From The Cradle To The Grave\",\"brand\":\"Dale Watson\",\"rank\":\"99,475 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B000NIW05C\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/51EvJA71w0L.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(June 1, 2016)\",\"Original Release Date:\":\"June 1, 2016\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"BIG DEAL RECORDS\",\"ASIN:\":\"B000NIW05C\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B000005U3C", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["paced"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["paced"]}, {"item_feature": ["humble"], "score": 0.01806565776117531, "users_matching_interest": ["good"]}], "recommender_score": 1.5260651173624658, "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B00005NW0P", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["paced"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["paced"]}, {"item_feature": ["blown"], "score": 0.012902458149879848, "users_matching_interest": ["amazing"]}, {"item_feature": ["listened"], "score": 0.017682937586532874, "users_matching_interest": ["song"]}], "recommender_score": 1.5223304413246515, "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B00005B8DE", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["paced"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["paced"]}, {"item_feature": ["grabs"], "score": 0.00776482002094173, "users_matching_interest": ["adds"]}, {"item_feature": ["confusing"], "score": 0.008604643370346735, "users_matching_interest": ["slow"]}], "recommender_score": 1.3345128714994408, "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B0007GAEVM", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["captivating"], "score": 0.007421473127568986, "users_matching_interest": ["paced"]}, {"item_feature": ["powerhouse"], "score": 0.011565523152836965, "users_matching_interest": ["production"]}], "recommender_score": 1.2609125292685543, "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Pop\",\"Vocal Pop\"],\"description\":[\"Tynan,Ronan ~ Ronan\",\"From his earliest days with the Three Irish Tenors, Tynan has harked back to sentimental forebears like John McCormack and Frank Patterson, who were wonderfully secure-voiced singers and musicians of remarkable taste and tact. But he also exemplifies the kind of theatrically brash, light \\\"classical\\\" singing made famous by the original Three Tenors, which in turn broke ground for popular sensations like Charlotte Church, Andrea Bocelli, and Sarah Brightman. His program this time out ranges from Broadway, to the pulpit, to unabashed pop. He commences with a selection from <I>Man Of La Mancha<\\/I>, which only proves that the composer had good reasons for writing the character of Don Quixote as a baritone. Despite the reverb-enhanced recording, Tynan's nasal enunciation and pitch problems are distracting and the orchestra and other accompanying musicians sound a bit distant. But fans of the artist will revel in Tynan's headlong versatility and engaging, sunny charm. --<I>Christina Roden<\\/I>\",\"\",\"\",\"<span class=\\\"h1\\\"><strong>Recommended Similar Titles<\\/strong><\\/span> <table cellpadding=\\\"4\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" cellspacing=\\\"4\\\">\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<tr class=\\\"tiny\\\" valign=\\\"top\\\" align=\\\"center\\\"> <td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B000059TBG\\/ref= ed_rt_6x_ellis\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B000059TBG.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>Ellis Island<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td>\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B00000I7I1\\/ref=ed_rt_6x_irish\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B00000I7I1.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>The Irish Tenors<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td>\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B00005TQ18\\/ref=ed_rt_6x_belongs\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B00005TQ18.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>My Life Belongs to You<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td> <\\/tr>\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<tr class=\\\"tiny\\\" valign=\\\"top\\\" align=\\\"center\\\"> <td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B00000IP3P\\/ref=ed_rt_6x_remembrance\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B00000IP3P.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>Remembrance<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td>\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B0000D9PST\\/ref=ed_rt_6x_kings\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B0000D9PST.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>We Three Kings<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td>\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"<td><a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ASIN\\/B0007OQ7GK\\/ref=ed_rt_rough\\\"> <img border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/P\\/B0007OQ7GK.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg\\\"><br><I>Rough Guide to Irish Music<\\/I><\\/a><\\/td> <\\/tr> <\\/table>\",\"\"],\"title\":\"Ronan\",\"brand\":\"Ronan Tynan\",\"rank\":\"89,817 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B0007GAEVM\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/61JvrFUxOnL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(March 1, 2005)\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"Decca U.S.\",\"ASIN:\":\"B0007GAEVM\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B000J3AF2G", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["quicker"], "score": 0.007253607832554754, "users_matching_interest": ["fast"]}], "recommender_score": 1.2413838924348877, "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Jazz\",\"Latin Jazz\"],\"description\":[\"10 Record Set includes: The beat of the brass,South of the border, Whipped cream and other delights, What now my love, S.R.O., The Lonely Bull, Going places, 40 greatest 2 albums , Sounds like, Rise.\"],\"title\":\"<span class=\\\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary a-text-normal\\\"\",\"brand\":\"Herb Alpert\",\"rank\":\"199,855 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B000J3AF2G\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/61hMJyRMp%2BL.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/51-XpG2aSNL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Original Release Date:\":\"1968\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"A&M\",\"ASIN:\":\"B000J3AF2G\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B000008HA5", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["awsome"], "score": 0.003141037630296627, "users_matching_interest": ["amazing"]}, {"item_feature": ["deservedly"], "score": 0.007008245054409979, "users_matching_interest": ["paced"]}, {"item_feature": ["drift"], "score": 0.009203917187183787, "users_matching_interest": ["fast"]}, {"item_feature": ["airplay"], "score": 0.009909437958904331, "users_matching_interest": ["stereo"]}], "recommender_score": 1.0991498964304829, "item_metadata": "[]"}], "users_interests": {"5": [["usage"], ["stereo"], ["production"], ["amazing"], ["song"], ["slow"], ["paced"], ["fast"], ["adds"], ["good"]]}}
