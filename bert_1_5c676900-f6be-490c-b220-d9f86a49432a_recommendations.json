A special re-issue celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary Coltrane album.<br><br>This historic Marsalis Music DVD, including a full performance plus bonus interviews and audio-only disc, will be re-released on April 13th 2015 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original John Coltrane A Love Supreme album from 1965. The DVD contains rare video material including a conversation with Alice Coltrane and Branford Marsalis.<br><br>About the record: Branford Marsalis and his quartet have been captured in a complete performance of John Coltrane s 1965 masterpiece A Love Supreme . This legendary suite was performed at Amsterdam s Bimhuis during a European tour in March 2003.<br><br>Marsalis acclaimed quartet - with pianist Joey Calderazzo, bassist Eric Revis and drummer Jeff Tain Watts - was all about the music as well, as they delivered a performance both musically and visually riveting. As a bonus to the live performance, all four members of the quartet, together with Branford s fellow saxophonists Michael Brecker, Ned Goold, David Snchez and Miguel Zenn, discuss the inspiration and the challenges presented by Coltrane s composition. In addition, Alice Coltrane, John Coltrane s widow and the pianist in his last band, is seen in a 30-minute conversation with Branford.<br><br> A Love Supreme is considered by many to be the ultimate expression of the classic John Coltrane quartet, and remains Coltrane s most popular album. Where Coltrane only performed the suite live on one occasion, Marsalis and band had several opportunities to play individual sections of the piece as well as in its entirety before filming:<br><br> One thing about A Love Supreme, it takes tremendous concentration and focus from every member of the band. The first time we played the whole thing live, all we could do afterward was sit in the dressing room for 20 minutes, totally exhausted. You don t see this band in that shape too often. By the time we got to the Bimhuis, though, we were up to the challenge. Branford Marsalis.<br><br>What has resulted a scintillating live performance, plus informed musical commentary and a rare visit with Alice Coltrane makes A Love Supreme Live in Amsterdam a must-have for all fans of Coltrane s and Marsalis music.<br><br>About Branford Marsalis: NEA Jazz Master, renowned Grammy Award-winning saxophonist and Tony Award nominee composer Branford Marsalis is one of the most revered instrumentalists of his time. The three-time Grammy Award winner has continued to exercise and expand his skills as an instrumentalist, a composer, and the head of 2002-founded label Marsalis Music. Leader of one of the finest jazz Quartets today, and a frequent soloist with classical ensembles, Branford has become increasingly sought after as a featured soloist with orchestras around the world.\"],\"title\":\"Coltrane's A Love Supreme Live in Amsterdam\",\"brand\":\"Branford Marsalis\",\"rank\":\"146,060 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B00SUFB0BU\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/611XUFri5sL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(May 26, 2015)\",\"Original Release Date:\":\"May 26, 2015\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"2\",\"Label:\":\"SONY MASTERWORKS\",\"Run Time:\":\"96 minutes\",\"ASIN:\":\"B00SUFB0BU\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B000002ATP", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["solos"], "score": 1.337092874758051e-16, "users_matching_interest": ["solos"]}, {"item_feature": ["improvisations"], "score": 0.001935240599217975, "users_matching_interest": ["solos"]}, {"item_feature": ["listened"], "score": 0.00646204684195433, "users_matching_interest": ["listening"]}], "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B00000477S", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["improvisations"], "score": 0.001935240599217975, "users_matching_interest": ["solos"]}], "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B0000560N6", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["orchestral"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["orchestral"]}, {"item_feature": ["soothing"], "score": 0.0030503347295503685, "users_matching_interest": ["relaxing"]}], "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Classical\",\"Forms & Genres\",\"Theatrical, Incidental & Program Music\"],\"description\":[\"This program seems designed primarily to display soprano <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/classical-artist-search\\/Jo%2C%20Sumi\\/${0}\\\">Sumi Jo<\\/a>'s fabulous singing and famous stylistic eclecticism.

His memory is still cherished and interest in his artistry was recently revived by the release of a number of amateur off-the-air recordings of performances from his Australian tour. By popular demand Music & Arts is re-issuing this 1997 album, of which Tim Page, Kapell s biographer, wrote: [The Prokofiev Third] is probably the finest performance of the concerto that Kapell left us and it is much preferable, in its spontaneity and poetic fury, to the curiously tame RCA Victor recording he had made a month earlier with Antal Dorati and the Dallas Symphony... The Brahms concerto is the last major work with orchestra that Kapell played in New York, slightly more than six months before he died. Here again, we have the Philharmonic (this time under Dmitri Mitropoulos on April 12, 1953) recorded in the luscious acoustics of the old Carnegie Hall. While there is still a good deal of brilliance in the playing listen to the ferocity with which Kapell attacks passages of exposed octaves there is also a welcome poise and serenity in softer passages and an abiding sense of formal structure throughout.\",\"William Kapell died at 31 in a tragic plane crash, just as he was on the cusp of a maturity that promised to ally an extraordinary technique to interpretive wisdom. He's at his best in these live performances. The Brahms, from a 1953 Carnegie Hall concert months before his death, shows a new lyricism in his art, along with sheer power and technical mastery. Mitropoulos's volatile accompaniments help create a masterful reading. The 1949 Prokofiev has all the dynamism and glittering pianistic fireworks that made Kapell famous, with the added plus of Leopold Stokowski's conducting. It's preferable to Kapell's more cautious studio recording of the piece for RCA. Sonics are on the raw side but no bar to enjoyment. <I>--Dan Davis<\\/I>\"],\"title\":\"William Kapell in Performance: Brahms &amp; Prokofiev Piano Concertos\",\"brand\":\"William Kapell\",\"rank\":\"59,476 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B000001OJ0\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/61Ub3CNQuOL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(December 2, 2008)\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"Music & Arts Programs\",\"ASIN:\":\"B000001OJ0\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B000MQC8X4", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["relaxing"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["relaxing"]}], "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Country\",\"Bluegrass\"],\"description\":[\"Smithsonian Folkways takes you to the heart of Appalachia for 38 vintage string-band sides-76 minutes on one CD!
