Beyond a bonus DVD, which mingles nature images, animation, and a few campy videos, <I>Myths and Legends<\\/I> includes a supplemental audio CD designed to be played simultaneously (on a separate system) with the main audio disc. Synching up two discs can be an unwieldy task, yet the effort yields an entertaining listening experience where the main disc is enriched by a wealth of sonic accents (roars, voices, rattles, and hums), giving Arkenstone's musical tales a deeper dimension. (The migration of electric guitar between the two discs during \\\"Daughter of the Sun\\\" provides some fun aural calisthenics.) So, is it great music or just a great gimmick? For fans attracted to Arkenstone's cinematic flourishes and storytelling reveries through sound, it's pleasant, usually interesting listening--another reminder that he remains a worthy contender for a major soundtrack project. Arkenstone adorns many compositions with Celtic, Middle Eastern, and tribal colors, and links many with a sense of spirited, seafaring swagger. His fondness for flutes sometimes softens his sound a touch too much, but at other times Arkenstone allows the cosmic winds to carry him to interesting, dynamic places (such as \\\"Tree of Life\\\"). <I>--Terry Wood<\\/I>\"],\"title\":\"Myths &amp; Legends\",\"brand\":\"David Arkenstone\",\"rank\":\"131,389 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B000P46QHM\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/51qncV5GtHL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(May 22, 2007)\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"3\",\"Label:\":\"Gemini Sun Records\",\"ASIN:\":\"B000P46QHM\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B0046EDAD0", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["reminds"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["reminds"]}, {"item_feature": ["terrific"], "score": 0.01650139077258167, "users_matching_interest": ["quality"]}], "recommender_score": 1.4230334288382647, "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Jazz\"],\"description\":[\"Japanese paper sleeve pressing.
