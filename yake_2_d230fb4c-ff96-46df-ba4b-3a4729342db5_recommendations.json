Seven centuries of Christmas passes before the listener with new works composed for these performers by Michael McGlynn, Andrew Smith and John Scott alongside traditional medieval and Renaissance carols and motets by Clemens 'non Papa', Philippe Verdelot and Toms Luis de Victoria. The wide-ranging sequence is anchored by Richard Rodney Bennett's Five Carols, in which the sopranos Sarah Brailey and Elizabeth Baber Weaver join in celebrating 'the joyful birth' and in praising 'Mary mild', that 'maiden fair and wise'. The wondrous events related to the Christmas story and the joy they bring to mankind naturally dominate, but intimations of Christ's death on the cross also surface in the course of the disc, as in Peter Warlock's Bethlehem Down: 'they will clothe him in grave-sheets, myrrh for embalming, and wood for a crown.' Formed in 2006, New York Polyphony has rapidly emerged as one of the leading vocal chamber ensembles, applying a distinctly modern touch to repertoire that ranges from austere medieval melodies to cutting-edge contemporary compositions. Two previous recordings for BIS have received critical acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for the 2013 release Times go by Turns, interleaving masses by Byrd and Tallis with works from the 21st century.\",\"&#34;Sing Thee Nowell&#34;, by the first-rate a cappella ensemble New York Polyphony, is a Christmas CD - but of that rare kind that functions as an antidote to the season's cash-register-jingling madness and forced jollity.&#34; <br>--Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, New York Times<br><br>&#34;...In December 2014, Sing Thee Nowell be-came the group's second Grammy-nominated album...&#34;<br><br>&#34;...the album does include some virtually flawless performances of great Renaissance choral works, it is the music written nature of the original hymn remains intact, and the ear easily grows ac-customed to the dense chord quali-ties by the third or fourth strophe...&#34;<br><br>&#34;...the women's voices assimi-late into the ensemble's texture quite eff ortlessly, matching vibrato when necessary and exhibiting the same level of pinpoint control...&#34; --John Guarente, Choral Journal, Volume 56, Number 5\"],\"title\":\"Sing Thee Nowell\",\"brand\":\"New York Polyphony\",\"rank\":\"97,871 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B00LWLZROK\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/61WpSy8bUNL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(September 9, 2014)\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"BIS\",\"ASIN:\":\"B00LWLZROK\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B008RTF100", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["reminds", "band"], "score": 0.011274610155318597, "users_matching_interest": ["feel"]}], "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"New Age\",\"Meditation\"],\"description\":[\"Nicholas Gunn spent 31 nights deep in the jungle and on the beautiful shores of Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula.
