The band’s signature style is primarily built upon Mark Knopfler’s simple yet haunting guitar licks. All other instruments, including the vocals, diffuse into each other comprising a serene atmosphere that pushes these melodic guitar licks forward as the salient element. "}

The hazy, powerful and emotional vocals are complemented by great guitar solos. It all comes natural as nothing is overdone or pushed."}

To my belief this album is a really nice entry to have a opinion on Cuban songs and culture. The album has some joyful songs like Candela and on the other hand some dramatic and blue songs like Dos Gardanias. This is my favorite album from the time I heard it for the first time. "}

There are many Phenonal songs like İkinci Bahar and Küçük Bir Aşk Masalı. The songs are romantic, clasic and have a really artistic jazzy melodies. Also the lyrics are as good as the lyrics of a quality poem. And the last thing, all the songs are sang by my favorite song writer and singer, Özdemir Erdoğan"}

That alone would be disturbing, but since the songs are formless and the production bland -- another reason why the hip-hop announces itself, even though it's nowhere near as pronounced as it has been since Butterfly -- her tired voice becomes the only thing to concentrate on, and it's a sad, ugly thing, making an album that would merely have been her worst into something tragic."}

An energetic, musically ambitious pop-rock record that employs its expanded vistas to animate punk's well-worn thematic underpinnings."}

It's impossible not to be impressed by ABBA's songwriting quality, arrangements, and great vocal sound. They offer some outstanding tracks, but Arrival is the first album that comes together as a coherent whole. Dancing Queen, one of the band's best songs, is included here. But every track, hit or not, is just great. Arrival is ABBA's simplest and best album lyrically."}

Outstanding Production and mesmerizing vocals. Their albums are made up of songs they feel are significant for that time in their lives. Each song tells a story of a single moment and is not part of a plotline or storyline. I enjoyed all songs, but I loved Whatever It Takes, Believer, Rise Up, Thunder more than the others. This album is very well structured and has a lot of different sounds and vibes. It is a mix of alternative rock,  indie, electro, and others that works!"}

In short, if you ignore Pitbull's horrible rapping (not that he appears a lot on the album), there are some great tracks. The album as a whole is not worth buying, but Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor), Give Me Everything, International Love, Castle Made of Sand, and Rain Over Me deserve a listen."}
