It is not just because popularity, but that ablum truly demonstrates how good rick wakeman is along with the other members of the yes. There are 3 pieces in this ablum and it is clear that the first one is the masterpiece, Close to the Edge. The well integrated organ to the song, organ solos and the classic progressive style is very dominant. The keyboard solo is a classic."}

She writes her songs herself and is possibly one of the best songwriters of Turkish Pop music. Some of the songs are very energetic and exhilarating and some are slow and sad. She achieves to blend all kinds of emotions in their albums and this is by far the best of them for me. In this album, there are also 2 - 3 Turkish folk songs. Her voice is so relaxing while she is singing slow songs and very confident while singing zippy ones."}
