Since then he has now been on 18 flights, throughout Europe. For this album he traveled even further, to Bethlehem to record two of the tracks his first visit to the Holy Land. Alessandro performed Adeste Fideles (Oh Come Let Us Adore Him) in the place where Jesus was born and he performed in the Shepherds Field where the Angel appeared to tell them of the birth of Jesus. He could not believe he was there it was magical, and the magic is captured in this new album. <br> <br>Also featured on two of the tracks is the official chorus of the Metropolitan Cathedral, Buenos Aires Coro Regina Coeli. They are the official choir to Pope Francis, when he was Archbishop in Argentina.
