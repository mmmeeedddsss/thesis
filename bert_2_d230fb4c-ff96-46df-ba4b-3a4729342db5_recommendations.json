Formed in 1993 on the heels of a production deal with Gene Simmons of KISS, T I L E S has developed a structured-yet-spontaneous compositional style that blends the adventure of progressive rock with an aggressive hard rock edge. <br><br>T I L E S has released five studio albums worldwide and recently commemorated their 20th anniversary with a pair of live recordings, Off the Floor 01 & Off the Floor 02 . The band has worked with renowned producer Terry Brown (Rush, Fates Warning) since 1997 and celebrated artist Hugh Syme (Aerosmith, Rush) since 1999. Their breakthrough third album Presents of Mind received praise from drummer Mike Portnoy who invited T I L E S to tour Europe with Dream Theater in 1999. Over the years the band has been nominated for several Detroit Music Awards in the Best Rock Album category and 2008 s Fly Paper album features a guest appearance by guitarist Alex Lifeson of Rush.<br><br>Now, after eight years..., T I L E S returns with a vengeance by delivering the mesmerizing 2-CD magnum opus Pretending to Run. Clocking in at over 96-minutes, Pretending to Run is an ambitious and richly crafted song cycle spinning the tale of a man blindsided and disillusioned by betrayal. Brooding and expressive, T I L E S explores the dark subject matter by blending stylistically diverse musical elements. Lyrical string arrangements, haunting choir performances, ambient textures and lush vocals co-exist with thundering drums, weaving bass lines and an army of guitars to create a vivid experience that delivers the story s emotional journey from isolation to redemption. <br><br>T I L E S teamed up again with producer Terry Brown and with mastering by Grammy award winning engineer Peter Moore, Pretending to Run boasts a powerful and detailed sonic landscape. Complementing the dramatic and multi-layered storyline is Hugh Syme s striking and surreal imagery. Featuring a lush 28-page full-color booklet, the design and packaging for Pretending to Run is an elaborate and stunning work of art.<br><br>Lending their talents to Pretending to Run is an extraordinary collection of special guest musicians: Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater, Winery Dogs), Adam Holzman (Steven Wilson Band), Mike Stern (Miles Davis), Kim Mitchell (Max Webster), Colin Edwin (Porcupine Tree), Kevin Chown (Tarja Turunen, Chad Smith), Max Portnoy (Next to None), Matthew Parmenter (Discipline), Mark Mikel (Pillbugs), Joe Deninzon, and other notable guests from the Detroit area... <br><br>Destined to be on the radar of Prog fans everywhere, Pretending to Run is a distinctive presentation framed in the grand traditions of progressive rock.
