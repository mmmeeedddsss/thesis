At the moment, seven quartets are recorded, four of which were probably intended for publication. Czerny composed in the tradition of Haydn and Beethoven. Echoes of Mendelssohn can be discerned as well as a romantic style full of drama and profundity of expression. The quartets have only been passed down as manuscripts from Czernys estate, which can be found in the archives of the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna.\",\"&#34;Here the Sheridan Ensemble makes a powerful case for them, demonstrating that Czerny had mastered the form even if he had no particular plans to push its boundaries.

Whatever the negatives of such live recordings may be, the upside trumps them handily since, if we're lucky, some of the sparks generated by musicians in a concert venue will be captured. With this set drawn from the 2005 Lugano Festival we're decidedly lucky, for musical electricity courses through all three discs. There are nine works by eight composers ranging from Mendelssohn to Guastavino, all played with spontaneity and full-blooded Romanticism. Argerich is onstage for five of them, including such rarities as Brahms' two-piano version of his Variations on a theme of Haydn, where she's partnered by Polina Leschenko, and, with Piotr Anderszewski, Grieg's full-dress arrangement for two pianos of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16, an oddity whose curiosity value outweighs the sacrilege. There's also the sensuous Argentine and Andalucian encores and the teenage Beethoven's Piano Quartet set alongside masterpieces such as the Brahms Piano Quintet, Op. 34 and Mendelssohn's Piano Trio No.2, both played with a captivating blend of sensitivity and fervor. For many the highlight will be two big Rachmaninoff works on Disc Two  Mischa Maisky's big-toned cello in the master's G minor Cello Sonata, whose episodic qualities the soloist turns into virtues, and the Suite No. 2 for two pianos, passionately played by Argerich and Gabriela Montero. Get this, put it in your player, and be transported to Festival-level performances by established masters and a new generation of stars. <i>--Dan Davis <\\/i>\"],\"title\":\"Live from the Lugano Festivals 2005\",\"brand\":\"Martha Argerich\",\"rank\":\"152,117 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B000FHYI3S\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/617wlrAPWdL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(July 18, 2006)\",\"SPARS Code:\":\"DDD\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"Warner Classics\",\"ASIN:\":\"B000FHYI3S\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B00000JRI5", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["emerson"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["emerson"]}, {"item_feature": ["underrated"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["underrated"]}], "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B000005S1N", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["remixes"], "score": 0.011605121039750256, "users_matching_interest": ["songs"]}], "item_metadata": "[]"}, {"asin": "B00004Z1CI", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["psychedelic"], "score": 0.0, "users_matching_interest": ["psychedelic"]}], "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Pop\",\"Oldies\",\"Baroque Pop\"],\"description\":[\"Digitally Remastered.
