This box emphasizes (but is not limited to) Taj's early career--the late-'60s through the mid-'70s--and whether he's playing solo acoustic instrumentals (\\\"Buck Dancer's Choice\\\"), revving up a rock band (\\\"Statesboro Blues\\\"), or weaving his National Steel guitar around tubas (\\\"Sweet Mama Janisse\\\"), the blues element is never far from center. He even brings out the Pointer Sisters, who funkify the blues standard, \\\"Sweet Home Chicago.\\\" The latter part of the box ventures into the 1980s and '90s, and features some songs for kids.
