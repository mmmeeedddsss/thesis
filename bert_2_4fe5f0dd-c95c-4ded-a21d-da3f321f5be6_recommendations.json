With superb quality audio, extensive liner notes and color booklet. Known throughout Country music as \\\"the Guitar Man\\\", the larger-than-life singer \\/ songwriter and Grammy Award winner gained recognition not only for a successful solo career but also as an actor and ace session guitarist. One of Nashville's finest \\\"pickers\\\", Reed was also adept at writing hit songs. Elvis Presley successfully covered 'Guitar Man', 'U.S. Male' (with Reed on guitar) and 'Talk about the Good Times'. Featuring Reed's original RCA Victor recordings, When You're Hot 1967-1983 comprises 26 Top 40 Country hits (including three #1s, 'When You're Hot, You're Hot', 'Lord, Mr. Ford' and 'She Got the Goldmine') plus classic albums tracks (including his own renditions of his signature tunes 'Guitar Man' and 'U.S. Male') - 28 tracks in total. Other highlights include 'Tupelo Mississippi Flash' (his tribute to Elvis), 'Amos Moses' (his swamp rock special which became a Top 10 crossover Pop hit in 1970), 'East Bound and Down' (his #2 hit from the Smokey and the Bandit soundtrack in which he co-starred with Burt Reynolds) and 'The Bird' (his #2 novelty hit from 1982). Reed's music has presence and character, alternating between a frenetic country sound and more pop-flavoured countrypolitan material but always displaying a freewheeling, playful quality.

This CD combines two complete Kirk LPs, <I>Rip, Rig and Panic<\\/i> from 1965 and <I>Now Please Don't You Cry, Beautiful Edith<\\/I> from 1967. The former is justifiably one of Kirk's most famous records, and it has possibly the most incendiary backing group he ever recorded with--secure, inventive, and prodding. Fueled by <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/36601\\/${0}\\\">Jaki Byard<\\/a>'s contrapuntal comping and flights into stride and atonality, <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/41486\\/${0}\\\">Richard Davis<\\/a>'s edge-of-the-beat bass lines, and <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/105884\\/${0}\\\">Elvin Jones<\\/a>'s polyrhythmic drumming, Kirk responds aggressively. His tenor improvisations on \\\"No Tonic Pres\\\" and \\\"From Byas, Bechet, and Fats\\\" are volcanic, while his manzello (a single reed in the soprano saxophone range) is piquantly lyrical on \\\"Black Diamonds.\\\" Always an innovator, Kirk adds electronically altered sounds to \\\"Slippery, Hippery, Flippery\\\" and shattering glass to the brilliant title piece. The later session is relatively subdued but still distinguished, with a more conventional rhythm section in pianist <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/107775\\/${0}\\\">Lonnie Liston Smith<\\/a>, bassist Ronnie Boykins, and drummer <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/49380\\/${0}\\\">Grady Tate<\\/a>. \\\"Blue Rol\\\" has Kirk paying glorious tribute to the <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/17834\\/${0}\\\">Ellington<\\/a> reed section, playing three horns at once before using circular breathing on manzello and then turning in a tenor solo worthy of an Ellingtonian like <a href=\\\"\\/exec\\/obidos\\/ts\\/artist-glance\\/41360\\/${0}\\\">Ben Webster<\\/a> or Harold Ashby. \\\"Why Don't They Know\\\" is percolating bossa nova, while the title tune is a beautiful ballad.
