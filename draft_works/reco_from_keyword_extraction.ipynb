new stuff too i recommend it to any slayer fan well best of s be a bite poison normally but this be not bad it s pretty good because i d have put 90 hell await reign in blood south of season divine and a couple musica s track and everything on god hat at that point best of mean every cd mainly so this be not so bad it dose put some great track that live show don t play much out there like 213 skeletons of society sex murder art and gemini and some rare track too final six be just a bonus track on christ illusion but it s here with the mystery cover songs from unditstputed attitude cd why these would be on a great hit collection i don t know but the also put a couple of live track on here too all in all it could be much bad but it s great for the car',\n 'what can i say this be cast crown this be a good bless fill cd enjoy cast crown and their songs another very inspirational collection by a very popular christian group another of my favorites i love the song slow fade by cast crown especially how they put the children version at the end its a song that speak to everyone of us to be careful on itch ears that may take our faith and attention away from the lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all time in the gospel the song slow fade speak to those who do not just live and walk in faith but also those who be still in the process of find themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the lord the lyric simply say people never crumble in a day its a slow fade when you give yourself away this be so true nobody change over night and we can start by be careful on what we fee our mind body ears eye and soul for our body be the temple of the lord and we be to keep it holy and live a christ like life all the time not just at certain time but 24 7 with or without people around us we may not get it all right at ones but its a slow fade when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it start by the choices we make on what to fee our body and soul this be an awesome album from the amaze christian group cast crown you can t go wrong with this album amaze and worth the buy i think if you like cast crown you d probably also like my current new favorite artist i find through myspace i think they ll be as big as cast crown and already start to see a huge interest in them see my other review for the warehouse band i can t believe i haven t write a review for this album yet maybe i didn t buy it from amazon lol i love this album to piece all the way from what this world need to every man slow fade to all because of jesus great just awesome i have the privilege of see this band perform at the norfolk scope in norfolk va back last november with my brother and i tell you what this band care for souls i only be a new christian for a couple of months prior i be on a spirtual high already and this band lift me up high cast crown be one of those exceptional contemporary christian band that you would feel comfortable have your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to i have lifesong and i know how much i enjoy that album still there most phenomenal work to date and then pick up the debut album self title cast crown if you want to listen to a band that actually love jesus and want everyone to know it i can guarantee this band will fulfill your crave this late effort by cast crown be an outstanding project as with their other albums it be lyrically powerful and have a great sound there be several very good songs on this album the album have a theme of challenge christians to live their faith all the time not just on sunday mornings there be a couple of praise songs and a prayer song include also but most of the track here have a message that be very hard hit to believers as with their previous albums i think that this one will produce several hit single east to west be already in that category others that be very good include what the world need every man and slow fade i would highly recommend this to anyone who be already a fan of cast crown for those who be unfamiliar with their music i would recommend start off with their self title debut in any case this be well worth buy i have get rip on previously cast crown review because i give them 4 star instead of 5 so there be no doubt people will go crazy with this review but with that be say this cd just wasn t very good once again cast crown do what it do best write songs point the finger at the church yes it be a good song with if we be the body and do anybody hear her but with what this world need it s just get old now it start to become annoy when a band harp on one point especially one that be as generalize as say the church isn t do what it be suppose to move on to another topic this cd also lack the catchiness of the last 2 albums and where the last 2 cd s have a solid 6 or 7 songs on them this album have 2 at most i just couldn t get into any of the songs musically it be average and the lyric be not up to par look forward to the new david crowder band album though which will surely not disappoint hope cast crown pull it together for its next album this one will sell a lot of units but will not stand the test of time it will collect dust on my shelf i remember the first time i hear cast crown on the radio several years ago it wasn t mark hall s voice the band s music or even the harmonies sing that draw me in it be the lyric i be go through a situation that voice of truth so eloquently and accurately address i honestly felt the lord mean for me to hear that song at that particular time i decide to go ahead and buy that album and find every song speak volumes to me now here we be 3 albums late and once again mark and his amaze ensemble of musicians have do it again they have put together an album that speak volumes to my heart i really like the way that cast crown albums generally have a theme this album be no exception i find the theme throughout this album be about stay in our comfort zone also know as the middle grind the safety zone but he also address the middle as in the gray area which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt mark sing about how we all have good intentions but when it come to step out of our comfort zone for god we say no way we give god a list that say i ll do this and this but there be no way i can or will do that or that fear be usually the big reason most of us don t step out of our comfort zone i be in no way point a finger because i find i be probably the guilty of all at do this that say this album truly help me to understand why i do what i do and how to remedy it it inspire me to seek out the lord in his word and in prayer and meditation the first song on the album what this world need be a great way to start off the album it have a rocky edge that draw you in to its chorus and before you know it you be sing along i actually have to listen to this song several time before i could fully appreciate what mark be try to say song 2 every man this song reference the fact that no matter who we be or what we ve do there be hope for us hope come in the form of jesus who know how we feel and can understand what we be go through 3 slow fade this be an amaze song that help us realize that no one go from be on fire for the lord to dabble with sin in one day no instead it be a slow fade satan know the best attack be a gradual attack which make black and white fade into gray 4 east to west one of my favorites on this album this be one of the songs on this album that speak to me personally it be with songs like this that i wonder if maybe god isn t give mark a look into my heart as if i m the only one struggle with issue like this 5 the word be alive as the title indicate this song be about the bible and how it bring forth hope to the hopeless and frail 6 the altar and the door one of my favorites also the altar and the door musically have a lot to offer it be very upbeat and easy to sing along with this song be one of the many that teach about how we get catch in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door i believe we all be guilty of this at some point in our walk with the lord 7 somewhere in the middle this be my absolute favorite song on the album for several reason one of which be that this song be easy to sing along with and secondly because it be such a deep song that carry a great amount of mean i really think it should be my anthem i admire mark s clever word play fearless warriors on a picket fence reckless abandon wrap in common sense deep water faith in the shallow end we be catch in the middle with eye wide open to the differences the god we want and the god who be what mark illustrate here be how contrary and fickle we as the body of christ can be we know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction but yet we stay in the middle grind where it be safe and easy instead of stand up for what be right which remind me of the great story of the three young men throw into the fiery furnace 8 i know you re there this song be great one of the ladies from cast crown sing this she do a terrific job and be able to carry her own without any problem this song be about know that god be always there for us 9 prayer for a friend this song which sound close to a ballad be about those we be close to get catch up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the lord 10 all because of jesus this be a praise and worship song that i think will one day be sing in church all over the world 11 white dive this song be completely different from anything cast crown have ever do i be not a big fan of it though i have to applaud them for try something different i highly recommend this album to anyone who worship with music i also recommend it to anyone who be feel lose in this big world cast crown do a great job of help its listener connect or re connect with god one more note this album be great to work out with i do my strength train and cardio workouts with this album i also like jog to this album christian soft rock group cast crown have take the christian music world by storm thank to two strong previous release and their third project should continue the trend the group have capture audiences with challenge lyric and great music there s nothing earth shatter with either but both work together to create some great music the disc start off with the rock anthem what this world need think if we be the body but fast the song remind us that the world need christ more then it need 100 perfect outward appearances after all the heart be what count the title of the album come from the idea that somewhere between hear what we should do during church the altar and drive away the door we loose the certainty and conviction we have i ll just say be there do that that theme be explore in two songs the first be the title track which really explain the theme good then i ever could and it s rather convict to hear my struggle put into word the second be the next track somewhere in the middle in fact the phrase between the altar and the door show up in this song too the song be a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in as with other cast crown s cds this one feature a couple worship songs and once again they don t grab me there s nothing wrong with i know you re there and all because of jesus but they aren t as special as some of their other track my two favorite songs be back to back slow fade be a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith it really drive home the importance of constantly stand guard because no one crumble in a day it s a slow song with a haunt sound and it end with lead singer mark hall s daughter sing because little eye it s enough to give me chill appropriately enough the next song be east to west as you might guess this song talk about forgiveness it explore the difficulty we have in accept god s forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under as with so many of their songs the lyric be powerful musically there be few surprise here for the long time fan but that s just fine because their music be wonderful i m surprise i haven t wear out cast crown s first two release i ve listen to them so often this one will certainly suffer the same fate',\n 'elvis be still the best great cd outstanding no one sing gospel songs with such true feel for god and jesus the way elvis do i find his gospel songs very comfort when i be upset about anything i think you will as well his 2 cd set with 40 songs call he touch me be one of my very favorites sincerely joan wear nashville tn great album ok great love it and i love it it truly be elvis at his best the songs be songs i know and can sing along if i want or i can just listen to the real elvis sing the kind of songs he love the best gospel a terrific collection',\n 'michael jackson have always be badd period from his

nice job represent both the motown epic years for michael and his brothers on disc 1 the first 2 cds be jam pack with a total of 38 songs many of which be feature as single edit which be fine as i already have the full versions the bonus 3rd disc be a nice treat but could ve be perfect if i ll be there dance machine and scream duet with janet be include it do however feature michael s 1 duet with paul mccartney say say say which have never appear on a jackson cd until now at any rate i recommend this affordable 3 cd set to fan who want a good michael jackson collection than number ones or aren t ready to purchase the ultimate collection which also fail to include a number of classics 38 songs of michael jackson s top songs wow can t beat that for this price i m very happy with this purchase we usually listen good music when drive somewhere usually a road trip will take 2 to 4 hours we like michael jackson s music and be never bore or annoy at all sound quality be great as well

michael jackson be great house clean or sit in traffic music there s no deny the impact michael jackson have have on popular music over the course of forty years from the jackson 5 s first no 1 i want you back when michael be eleven through his untimely death at the age of fifty i be still in high school when michael and his brothers release four consecutive no 1s something not even the beatles do despite michael s popularity i remain essentially a casual fan i didn t buy a michael jackson album until thriller an album that spawn seven hit single and have sell over 100 million copy to date i eventually buy 1995 s history and late 2001 s great hit but if you re look for one collection to hit all the highlight of a brilliant career i buy mine as a black friday deal this be everything the casual fan need solo hit start with 1971 s get to be there through 1999 s you rock my world along with a sprinkle of jackson 5 jacksons hit the only glare omissions be the duets with his sister janet scream and paul mccartney say say say overall this be two and a half hours of music that change the landscape of popular music forever this music belong in any serious collector s library essential run time disc 1 78 56 disc 2 78 50 the title say it all it have all the classics and popular mj hit 2cd pack a must have for everyones collection it s no secret that michael jackson be incredibly talented and gift musician the fact that he also have a passion for his art must have help this two discs collection cover the man s entire career from the time he be a little kid up to his late years as one of the most famous person on this planet it serve as an example of how great his music be and how it s still amaze today few artists have have the impact that mj have on the music industry michael revolutionize it and in the 1980 s michael be fashion mj s certainly have an interest musical career and the essential michael jackson be all the proof you need we could go into how thriller be the best sell album of all time or how history be the best sell double disc album of all time or how blood on the dance floor be the best sell remix album however the point here be not to demonstrate michael s numerous accomplishments in the music industry it s how good his music be the first 8 songs of this great hit album be from michael s time in the jackson 5 jacksons then we get 4 songs from off the wall 1979 7 songs from thriller 1982 8 from bad 1987 7 from dangerous 1992 and 1 from both history 1995 and invincible 2001 all the hit you would expect be here don t stop till you get enough billie jean thriller bad and much more there isn t much to say about the songs include they re all great in their own way and deserve to be on this essential collection besides the ultimate collection box set this compilation be by far the most comprehensive look at michael s career it cover not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the jackson 5 jacksons which be a nice feature of this compilation disc michael jackson compilations tend to be focus only on his solo career i can t hide the fact that i m a little disappoint that there be only one song from both history and invincible those latter years album be not huge hit for michael although history sell very well and go on to become the most successful double disc album of all time but i still like them both and think more songs from these albums could should have be include they don t care about us and earth song be excellent songs from history that would have be excellent to have on a career spawn collection from invincible i think whatever happen should have be here and perhaps butterfly it s easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums be include they do not really match the pop hit in term of lyric or musicality they be much more personal and less accessible than material from thriller or bad for instance that aside the essential michael jackson give buyers what they really want the hit and more well know songs i must add it do a good job at do so the essential michael jackson do an excellent job of go further than your average compilation and offer michael s hit and some of his best songs the fact that it cover his entire career be great you get a proper overview of jackson s music for someone who be relatively new to michael jackson s music this be really the essential michael jackson 4 5 while it have be six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of michael jackson many people have recently rediscover what have make him such a strong and influential singer and the icon he be not the joke he be label that dog him through the past several years nevertheless it have be quite easy to forget in any such way why he be recognize as the king

talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the cd show it i be truly devastate over the loss of mj i be still cry about it he will live in my heart forever i only wish the negative people would have know the real mj listen to his word look at his various videos on the web in regard to children read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy you will know why he be acquit because he be totally innocent from day one and every juror know it god bless his beautiful children i be look forward to the day his children be old and they give an interview on what a wonderful daddy he be this be the only michael jackson album you need to buy it have all the essential hit track span his entire career while he have tons of hit all of his individual albums have songs that be not hit and not good songs so there be no need to buy the individual albums unless there be a particular song that be not on this essential album that you be look for outside the supernova explosions of the early jackson 5 michael jackson s peak years be 80 82 of off the wall and thriller in fact thriller and its breakthrough extend length video dominate mainstream popular music during its amaze chart run those years also however host rebellions against that same mainstream with punk and new wave band continually storm the staid pavilions a lot of people be feed up with corporate crap top down think and the pop band as commodity tool michael jackson be anything but staid but he be of them i mean quincy jones industry creation though he be jackson synthesize the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith plunge his music into the currency of sexual politics well beyond the dance floor blather that typically decorate even genius killer groove he produce the tough most sophisticate work of his career in billie jean that song touch off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex but as big as thriller be michael jackson never again display the confident at ease sexuality of off the wall and his hit be scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers hall and oates from that point on the open jackson 5 bomb detonate here as if prepare you and the big early 80 s hit still deliver a huge amount of excitement this hold well up into bad open the second cd then slowly unwind until midway into the second disc it completely disappear under a showcase of embarassing schlock and that include the doa dance floor misfire dangerous which do nothing to illuminate beat cue crib from prince the essential michael jackson show a tantalize artist on a blaze short run shape the best dance groove in the land into actual cohesive songs i certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listen to this essentials package that jackson s place in the pantheon be cushion with pad who would have ever think michael jackson would die in this era it doesn t seem real he wasn t suppose 2 die this collection of hit be almost as good as buy all of his solo work i actually would rather have each individual album but i don t have time for all that and i already own hundreds of cds so the essential michael jackson make the most sense for content and consolidation reason but i still would like the artwork and other track from the other cds but i just don t feel like buy them so i just buy this i go to 5 different store and they be all sell out i finally get the last copy but i have to pay 25 i think alot of people be just buy this cd as a trinket i actually want to listen to the music so stop buy it if you be just go to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it as for the music i don t like any of the jackson 5 stuff it sound date and all the songs be overplay i like ben in my oppinion that s the only good song mj do when he be really young they leave out never can say goodbye which be about the only good jackson 5 song so that suck all mj s other hit be on here from all the albums the only other song i m piss about be jam i wish they would have include that song but i don t want to have to go out and find a copy of dangerous just for that song life be complicate and the music industry always make it complicate for music fan i wasn t really impress with the pics in the liner note they could have include good unreleased pics of michael i be a michael jackson fan even though i disconnect with him and his music during the child molestation stuff now that he die i can feel good about pay him tribute and listen to his music again after all i do a lip sync of bad in full costume in high school drama class mj be a part of my life god bless u michael this world love u one last note farewell my summer love should have be include on this cd that song be probably impossilble to find i use to have it on 45 even though michael jackson s personal life be rock with scandal and i didn t always approve of his antic but i cannot ignore the cultural impact this gift performer have on me as a child i be in bear in 1982 i remember hear him on the radio and think wow what a voice the song be dirty diana from his bad album it wasn t until 1991 when his dangerous album be release that i become a fan of jackson black or white be a stellar video and the cd be just pure pop candy i eat it up after the scandal break in 1993 i lose interest in jackson but now that he be no long with us i hope will be remember for his music and dance ability he be one of a kind this collection of great hit be spectacular there be couple of jackson 5 classics and of course the best track of his career like thriller billie jean human nature the man in the mirror in the closet shake your body down to the grind she s out of my life will you be there and don t stop til you get enough he change the sound and look of pop music forever rip michael thjere be many michael jackson cd s on the market this be the one to own however since it capture all of his big hit and well represent my two favorite albums off the wall and thriller his best songs be all here rock with you don t stop til you get enough beat it billie jean the girl be mine human nature etc as well as his early hit with the jackson five and the great late albums like bad and dangerous this be the best sound representation of these hit i have ever hear there be 37 cut michael be indeed an american tragedy and a pop music icon if you can only own one cd this be the most logical choice my only quibble be the omission of never can say goodbye which be my favorite jackson five song at one time he be sell over one million albums cd s a day 1983 84 he change the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics highly recommend in 2005 sony release without much or any fanfare the terrific essential michael jackson which easily be the best michael jackson compilation available these days it also release a slightly different international version which i recently pick up while in china no i didn t buy it from a pirate cd hawk character on some street corner in fact i buy it in a regular cd store in shanghai for all of 39 rmb about us 5 50 if you can believe that the international version of the essential michael jackson 2 cds 38 track 156 min differ only slightly from the us version 1 the jacksons can you feel it replace enjoy yourself an improvement 2 somehow i just can t stop love you from bad be lump along with and in the middle of the thriller songs on cd1 obviously not an improvement 3 the title track from dangerous be leave off and instead 2 track from 1995 s history second cd of new material be add earth song and they don t care about us a wash as far as i m concern although earth song remain a greatly underappreciated tune how they don t care about us end up on the essential list be a head scratcher although i like the song would i have buy this again if it wasn t for the ridiculous low price in china almost certainly not but i be glad i do if nothing else because it be just another memento from my trip to china the chinese version come with mandarin character on the cover that aside the essential michael jackson be a terrific album whether you buy the us version or the international version and it really showcases michael jackson at his best michael jackson be a timeless musical genius he own the last century dick clark get it right when he give mj the award as

of these title be miss hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore great hit album this be just as strong and vibrant as the box set that come 8 months before it i send a copy of it to my uncle in georgia a few days after it come out on july 12 sony make a smart move to release this after michael jackson be declare innocent this one like the box set combine his jackson 5 hit his jacksons hit and his solo hit go up to 2001 past albums stop at thriller but this go even further to invincible but my favorites be on here from get to be there i want you back shake your body blame it on the boogie off the wall beat it billie jean in the closet remember the time another part of me bad dirty diana the hummable song smooth criminal dangerous and you rock my world the sound s a little loud but i think they want a full complete listen experience to the listener the package say 37 songs but there be 38 songs here and what a spectacular collection of michael s hit i know there be people say but why isn t butterfly or state of shock on here it must have be tough decide what to put on here because michael have always make quality music to usher justin timberlake omarion and the top singers dancers you be all great artists but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of michael jackson keep work at it i could play these cds all night long because all my favorites be on here can you hear those funky beat and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album go down an interstate for 100 170 miles or so on a road trip this be yet another great compilation album of michael s hit probably good than 2003 s number ones get multiple copy to send to your family members and friends truth be michael jackson need a 2 disc collection as much as anybody those single discs didn t quite do it for somebody who s still often call the king of pop so the pros and con i personally don t need the jackson 5 material myself but some might i also think this be a bite shy on his most recent work i do miss earth song and the duet scream with janet too however many of his best songs come from thriller and bad and we get most of those here in fact there be 7 of the 9 songs from the original thriller album and even more from bad plus we get the best of off the wall and again some of his early stuff the fact be after listen to this collection of michael jackson you almost can t not like him it s just human nature despite all the controversy that have occur with michael jackson he be truly the king of pop and he truly have one of the best record voice ever you can t deny that michael jackson be one of the most influential artists not only in pop but also in the twentieth century of music itself thriller have sell millions and millions of record and continue to sell and stand the test of time this collaboration be one of the most complete mj collaborations that i have see this one not only contain jackson s solo career but also contain his work with the jackson 5 unfortunately maybe this should ve be a 3 disc set because there be a few of his most notable hit miss include i ll be there a standard song in jackson s arsenal otherwise it be probably the most complete compilation that you will find for mj it be wonderful relive hit such as i want you back billie jean thriller wanna be startin something don t stop til you get enough and etc 4 star when i saw that sony have make michael jackson the late artist to be anthologize in their the essential series i really be surprise to be honest since the series never actually cover of this magnitude i be compel to say that they only compile this collection because they want to cash in on the revive interest in his music after his not guilty verdict if this be indeed the case then it shouldn t really matter since the two disc the essential michael jackson be actually an affordabel and for the mosr part comprehensive collection for a person who only want to own one michael jackson cd now i do not have this cd i already own the four disc box set and thriller all a fan need really but i already own must of the songs so i feel that i be qualify to write a review for it if you re the casual jackson fan you pretty much get all the stuff you need the jackson 5 hit though i ll be there and dance machine be strangely omit early solo hit late jacksons recoridngs and all the hit from his trifecta of best sell albums off the wall thriller bad and dangerous the hit from those album make up well over half the collection you will also get two post 1992 record the 1995 megahit you be not alone and the 2001 top ten single you rock my world as with most if not all entries in the essential series as with most compilations there be some problems judge by how many songs be on each discs some track be bind to be edit most of these songs be the single versions that we re use to hear so we shouldn t really be bother buy this except that thriller lose its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approach the door etc also there be some track leave off such as i ll be there i wanna be where you be dance machine ease on down the road the paul mccartney say say say the only one of michael s solo number ones to be omit though it may be because it be originally release on a paul mccartney solo album rather than one of michael s state of shock the jacksons collaboration with mick jagger and the janet jackson duet scream however as a whole this collection will not disappoint and be highly recommend for casual fan but not so because of it s lack of completion as in the past great hit compilations by michael and the jacksons there have always be filler but no thriller hit with pit so this compilation be the best so far picture include be his best photos show off a talented singer songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess the quality of the master be far superior than previous compilations include that of the early hit from motown like i want you back abc and get to be there the track information be informative and i don t recall another compilation that have such detail but the reason for the 1 less star be that it do not complete the essential and add 2 songs that be not essential for this type of cd grant he have have more 1 hit and more top 40 hit than most over 4 decades here from 1970 2000 but where be the 1 essential i ll be there or dance machine they could have leave out dangerous which never chart and leave me alone which be an essential but not a hit as well the video be a big hit ok now what s next maybe volume 2 essential and whoa where do this come from without any hype or media attention sony have just release the essential michael jackson 37 track 157 min perhaps the ultimate michael jackson compilation cd 1 20 track 79 min cover the period up to and include the thriller album start with the best know jackson 5 single such as abc and i want you back then shift to the jacksons it would have be good to include state of shock or lovely one instead of enjoy yourself cd1 finish off with 7 of the 9 thriller album track the other 2 be baby be mine and the lady in my life it s still hard to believe how successfull that album really be and how many hit be relased from it in the days when radio track mean actual vinyl single release this be of course michael at his absolute best now 23 years ago cd2 17 track 78 min compile 8 track from bad and 7 from dangerous and finish off with you be not alone from history and you rock my world from invincible in other word only 2 tune from the post 1992 era and rightfully so even though the history and invincible albums be not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe the only track that arguably should be on here but at 78 min already at the expense of what other track then be scream the no 1 duet with sister janet in the end this essential compilation be good than any other compilation available history vol 1 number ones etc as it cover both the jackson 5 jacksons era and his solo output it s very strange to me that this be release without any hype or advertize campaign but the main thing be that it s out and available hihgly recommend',\n 'classic one of the best thrash albums from any band this whole record set a standard for others to try and reach few would ever come close c mon it s classic metallica these single disc remasters be do on the cheap end they didn t even bother to paint the disc the only thing tell you this be remastered be a little snippet in the booklet which be basically just the cover back and a page with lyric it s all fairly pedestrian i literally send the first disc back because i think it be the 80s disc i cannot believe they go so cheap on these it be literally almost impossible to tell this be a remastered disc the three disc master of puppets release be by far the best one for the affordable versions the remaster here have some slight tweak but otherwise sound nearly the same as the old disc dynamic range be still very good for metal if you want to revisit these classics these cheap editions be the way to do it i just wish they have give the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet bare minimum quality digipack but it be low cost i guess i just expect some kind of decent booklet with this remaster this album sound great on vinyl no crackle at all the new blacken record press be great who doesn t have ride the light sound awesome remastered and the package be good than those jewel case best 5 buck you ever spend for those wonder this cd be indeed remastered both this album and kill em all with april 2016 release date be remastered versions not just simple reissue it sound improve versus the original cd release although not drastically so enjoy you ll love it after you get it but in the mean time check out rollingbaby com for all your baby stroller info great stuff i have the album years ago and i want to get it on cd i already have one of the fine versions of ride the lightning on cd as a basis for comparison i hadn t be able to find many review on the new 18 99 vinyl i purchase this at b n with a coupon in store today but will share with my amazon brethren as i get 95 of my new vinyl here and love to add to the review that i myself greatly depend on i have decent mid fi equipment not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior record 1978 japanese technics sl 220 with at95e tc750 yamaha rx v377 hd598 and the cd on the same rx and phone via yamaha cdp s300 i prefer the vinyl by a good margin though the only fault i can find be the vocals be a little low in this mix record be dead flat as in free of warp drill dead center poly line paper sleeve lyric sheet download card before play the record be clean with a i 6 via kabusa ev 1 very quiet background and dead silent between track generous lead in area and dead wax i think the overall time be just a hair over 47 00 it may be the most quiet metal record i own as far as background and darn sure be the best for 18 99 or less the record volume overall be a tad low but nothing that s not easily overcome by the volume control i be impress to the point that i will now seek out the new release of kill em all and puppets despite puppets have some issue accord to review so yeah mix sound nice and balance good bass vocals recess a tad but not a big deal imo very happy with the price quality would recommend kill em all be my favorite thrash era metallica and this album bridge the gab between that album and puppets classic metallica since amazon have lump the elektra cd release of this album i must specify which release i be review i be review the 2000 24 karat gold cd edition of ride the lighten remastered by steve hoffman this be a mobile fidelity sound lab release just so people know i own a few of their miles davis lp s remasters which sound amaze now back on track i have own and play the hell out of ride the lighten 1995 cd put out by elektra while that version sound good the 2000 hoffman remaster blow any other cd edition out of the water the album just have more life organic sound and do not sound harsh or filter the source material mr hoffman work on this release with be the original master tap of the album while the 1995 cd edition of rtl do not sound much different from the original vinyl version it do go through digital filter possibly noise reduction and a few other things my reason for buy this version be i have hear metallica have remastered ride the lighten again and be release a box set for the album after hear the sound on the album in that box have fall victim to the loudness war i search for an alternative snag a decently price copy of this long out of print remaster be luck on my part all i have to say be if you care about sound stay far away from the rtl 2016 box set it have nice extras which be tempt but yeah this 2000 mfsl steve hoffman remaster be the way to go best sound version of rtl in my humble opinion awesome album miss out of my collection a true classic for metal fan solid album with no clunkers i think this one of their best albums the sound be incredible as a whole but the bass work be awesome another must have to add to the collection you win t be disappoint if you pick this up ty one of the best great just get it today 8 8 2015 i love it awesome fantastic amazon be like a xmas wonderland i will be do all of my shop here great music store great amazon have everything you could ever imagine or want o this album be fantastic the play and attitude along with great lyric make this one of their fine record just behind mop and the black album no problem like with a handful of the albums i own in my now far large cd collection this album have be in my possession since i be about 14 so needle to say i should have do this review a very long time ago straight to the point i really have to say that this be my absolute favorite metallica album of all time as a perfect follow up to kill em all the sophomore album ride the light mark a point in their career when they be in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal make a name for themselves as a band and further rise to prominence in the 80s metal scene with a dark and eerie atmosphere couple with massive thunder guitars skull crush drum and raspy vocals no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfy upon even the first listen and will never want to skip over any songs every one of the songs on this album be a perfect illustration of what define the true sound of metallica and what make them such a great band from the high speed neck break insanity from songs such as fight fire with fire trap under ice creep death to the more steady yet eerily menace for whom the bell toll and fade to black this be the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any true metallica fan honestly there be so much more i could say about this album that other have say before i could go on all day about it this my friends be the true metallica in their prime and the define sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it sadly this period of their career in which they value their art and stay true to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the 80s we all know how they start to care more about money and sell out to the mainstream by go in a more alternative direction ultimately destroy their own legitimacy as a metal band see my review of their self title black album but at least we still have this album along with kill em all master of puppets and and justice for all to remind us of how awesome of a band they use to be all in all this be definitely one album that make no sense not to own if you consider yourself a true metallica fan or a true metalhead in general just buy this album already you know you want to horn up m m awesome thrash metal classic the songs on this album be great they all rip make me angry when i listen to it good stuff this be how metallica be mean to be play and enjoy loud and clear it s a great album 4 5 star i recently get into metallica and so i m obsess with find everything they have do this be an old album but it s amaze i watch some documentaries about them and have no idea that they be an underground band which make their success even cool every song be great the call of ktulu be insane they be all extremely talented and this show why people like their music so much i love this album i still have the original vinyl picture disk but want to add the cd to my collection in my very humble opinion this be their best album with garage days a close second metallica create a thrash masterpiece with ride the lightning after their glorious debut kill en all metallica refine their raw punk thrash into something more meaningful while kill en all be a hallucinate young raw thrash petard ride show a mature side in metallica with introspective lyric and even a powerful ballad fade to black well in my opinion be a complete masterpiece with gens like the title track fight fire with fire for whom the bell toll and creep death well do metallica ride the lightning be another example of good metal music do by a great metal rock band the album itself be just like and justice and all deal with death in certain songs like fade to black for whom the bell toll and creep death the album have a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time i buy it i be deal with thoughts of death and the metallica music infulence my release throw my poems i write and really help me get throw a dark period in my life but the actual music have some amaze metal music within it and deep powerful lyric in it so if your look for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you throw a dark period your go throw just like it help me throw mine as i write my poems and other items i write sometimes you just need to blow off steam and when i get tire of my boss at work or i can t find a date i like to rock and or roll metallica have be rock the free world for big time and i be one of their most passionate fan i love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck go over the side of a cliff sometimes i ll be drive and i ll pull up to some ying yang play hip hop way too loud out of their ford focus and then i flip the switch on my stereo to ride the lightning and it blow their high school bs off the road if my parent let me i m go to get a freedom tattoo on my neck and one of lars ulrich s face on my right hand that way if my parent go out for the night it ll be me and lars alone and there s not a court in the land that can stop us from do anything we want this be an awesome cd from start to finish i love the way the cd start off with a slow guitar intro on fight fire with fire then all of a sudden it get up in your face with hard metal i love it my favorite song on here be fade to black which be my favorite metallica song of all time but every song on this album rock just a shame there be only eight track on here though i wish there be a re release of this with bonus track such as outtakes or something cool like that ride the lightning be one of my favorite metallica album it present a fast and harsh music and lyric respectively similar to that style of slayer i often state that ride the lightning and kill em all be two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums if you re new to metallica this and the follow up master of puppets be the albums to get if you re a metal fan anyways these 2 be hand down their best for an at the time little know metal band the production be really good everyone be in top form jam s vocals be a little high than they d be after this album which add to the charm of this album the band be drive they have some good material partly thank to megadeth frontman dave mustaine and they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan s attention fight fire with fire 10 10 start off with an acoustic intro that fade out as the electric guitars fade in all this to lead into possibly the fast metallica song ever this be a perfect opener with great guitar work and vocals this be definitely in a long list of favorite songs by metallica which every song with lyric on this album actually be on ride the lightning 9 10 be an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verse plus a catchy chorus overall a very good song for whom the bell toll 10 10 might be my favorite metallica song ever grant it have stiff competition but it might be this one have a nice groove to it this one s still fairly heavy but not as heavy as the past 2 songs there be some good melodies and the guitar play be really good i hate to give credit to lars but his drum really add power to this song fade to black 9 10 be the first metallica ballad it start with an acoustic guitar with some electric lead it doesn t really have a chorus just a riff instrumental base chorus similar to what black sabbath do a lot and it work fine the first 2 verse be slow ballad acoustic style then the song speed up for the bridge and solo overall a very good song trap under ice 9 10 after a ballad what do any good metal band do they come back with a fast pace thrasher which be what they do here this be the second fast song on the album the song have a nice pace to it and be an overall fun listen escape 9 10 be kind of the pop song of the album odd it get no recognition this be probably the catchy song on the album this one s similar pace to ride the lightning it have a really good chorus and be yet another in a long list of great songs on here creep death 10 10 be another contender for favorite metallica song it s a fairly fast pace thrasher with a great horus it have some slow part as well and be a great way to close out the album then there s an instrumental which i win t rate because i m not really into instrumentals it s play just fine so i m sure for fan of them it ll do overall if you re a metal fan new to metallica which would be surprise this be a good place to start you win t be disappoint ride the lightning be a lot good in my opinion but both be still great albums rtl have the best of early thrash speed metal but it also have some progressive influence that would show more on their next 2 release ride the lightning have the perfect mix and it s a classic the band mature also from their previous both musically and lyrically it s a but dark than their first album it s also their first album to feature cliff burton on bass in every track replace ron mcgovney which he be the original bassist dave mustaine be fire in 1983 and form megadeth former exodus guitarist kirk hammet replace him and rtl be their first to feature him on guitar the band get their line up together here all of the songs be great but creep death be my personal favorite this be a piece of metal magic all the songs be glorious one all the songs be classics metallica really create metal magic on ride the lightning the lyric be truly amaze and the sound be the fine thrash metal if you like metal you reeeeeeally have to listen to this absolutely classic metallica be truly one of the force to be reckon with in their genre of music whether you call it metal heavy metal or thrash be of little importance they re one of the greats while everyone have their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out metallica already prove themselves to be a great band with their debut album kill em all which have that early real raw and unpolished sound that make it a fan favorite 1984 s ride the lightning expand on the formula of kill em all and show a bite more maturity i mean the debut be great and it show a lot talent it also show a lot of anger from some seriously p off teenagers you can see a certain progression a development from the first album and they be become more and more the band that would release master of puppets ride be a dynamic and solid album all the way through it also feature tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that s still very much present more than 25 years late the open song fight fire with fire with its gentle guitar open give the impression that it s go to be a slow and soft song than usual for metallica wrong it soon change and suddenly become very fast perhaps one of the fast metallica songs excellent track to begin an excellent album the title track ride remain to this day one of my favorite metallica songs with its incredibly fast solo and powerful lyric for whom the bell toll have one of the most iconic intros in metal once again amaze lyric by jam take a look to the sky just before you die it s the last time you will sound nice doesn t it fade to black can almost be consider a ballad for the band the lyric be so personal and depress yet the song be uplift it s a slow song for metallica but it progressively get heavy the song have such a strong feel it s hard to overlook how great it be in fact it s one of my favorite metallica track to this day trap under ice escape and creep death be also very good songs that should not be ignore those songs be excellent but have not often be play live the call of ktulu be an amaze 8 minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that ride the lightning while not a concept album be mostly about the different type of death and ways of die and it show in the song title ice electrocution and others make of ride a dark record ride be also the last album on which dave mustaine receive credit here he be credit on two track the title track and the instrumental the call of ktulu jam come up with some particularly great lyric on ride the lightning as he usually do but here it s really special ride have terrific guitar work courtesy of jam hetfield and kirk hammet excellent bass from cliff burton and solid drum from lars ulrich it would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that have a huge role and impact on the thrash movement these songs be classic metal track and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt know all about them already some prefer the early raw metallica sound of kill em all and some prefer the acclaim master of puppets album with respect to those two amaze alums out of the three first metallica albums i ll have to say that ride the lightning be my personal favorite out of the three and be probably the one i like best of all the albums the band have do i love master just as much as the next guy but it s be overplay some of the stuff here have be overplay as well but to a less degree as much as i love the rawness of kill em all i think the band be good on ride everyone be entitle to their own opinion and mine be that ride the lightning be an amaze metallica album it feature deep lyric skillful guitar play and be everything there be to like about the band to begin with a total metal album i very much enjoy this ride years late 5 5 for this one a masterpiece and a landmark of thrash metal and metal in general when fan talk about metallica many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics group them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre what i see many people fail to point out be that ride the lightning be just as huge a shift in sound and style from kill em all as the black album be from and justice for all when metallica write kill em all thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn t exist yet they be influence by speed metal band like venom and motorhead and produce a debut album where the musical traits of those band be stamp clearly on just about every song start with ride the lightning metallica make a full shift to thrash essentially define the genre by make far more use of shred riff melodic solo and high speed double bass drum while jam still utilize his scream on track like trap under ice he employ a deep overall tone and use a more gruff delivery you really don t hear many similarities to kill em all musically i mean what songs from ride the lightning would sound right on that album in my opinion none they show incredible progression and maturity from the wild intense nature of kill em all to the control powerhouse approach of ride the lightning the album itself be an easy five star bold statement right what metal fan doesn t know for whom the bell toll and fade to black by heart crush thrash songs like fight fire with fire the title track trap under ice and creep death be relentlessly aggressive escape highlight the melodic nwobhm influence that be virtually non existent on kill em all the perennial favorite metallica instrumental the call of ktulu round out one of the great metal albums of all time it have a sound completely distinct from their others have some of the best songs in metallica s catalog and without question belong in any collection of heavy music first of all if you don t know about metallica you probably be very young just buy it for the begin all the songs be master super heavy metal songs i remember how many time i have hear this album fade to blcak for whom the bell toll creep death the call of ktullu and the other songs be just amaze there be a strong feel by hear this songs it seem like metallica be turn into a band that you either love or hate as years go by that s pretty sad because the band be essentially one of the all time great metal band of all time some people will say that they re overrate well i say that i still enjoy their music a whole lot a majority of their albums be live proof that they can create powerful and haunt music ride the lightning the second album and the first without former member dave mustaine be an all around masterpiece from begin to end it s pure brilliance songs like fade to black and creep death be sure to please every metallica fan out there for whom the bell toll be not only my personal favorite on the album but also my personal favorite from the band themselves it s five minutes of pure awesomeness the call of ktulu be a 9 minute instrumental that may be bore to some but i find the melodies and sound to be completely engage in short i win t describe what the songs mean or sound like since i m sure almost every reviewer on this page be metallica fan i ll just conclude by say that ride the lightning be a great metal album grade 9 8 10 i buy this album for the song for whom the bell toll after watch zombieland several time and realize this be one of the few metallica albums i didn t have great addition to my metallica collection ride the lightning be metallica s 2nd studio album and their 1984 release be truly an incredible album the album have produce some of the best thrash metal that i have ever listen to the songs that i especially like be for whom the bell toll and fade to black all the lyric be include in the book along with some photos of the band we also get a list over whom play what the album be meet with rave review by the critics allmusic and kerrang both give the album very high mark in their review 5 5 metallica s second album be nothing short of amaze the riff be amaze the solo s be epic the vox be stellar and the songs be second to none with classics like ride the lightning for whom the bell toll trap under ice call of ktulu etc this album be a fine example of thrash at it s best metallica s second best album mostly due once again to mustaines amaze songs this be one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it s just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general but i can t put this ahead of master of puppets talk of metallica albums usually pass over ride the lightning you hear how great master of puppets be the transition that be the black album and general disgust at st anger the truth be without ride the lightning we never would have see any of the others ride the lightning be metallica s sophomore album and it represent a quantum leap forward over kill em all set the sound that have come to be know as metallica to us the songs be more refine yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor while it would late be refine into master of puppets arguably the great metal album ever this album be still a masterpience contain fade to black and for whom the bell toll as well as the very well do instrumental track the call of ktulu definitely an essential pickup for a metallica fan and one of the first few albums you should buy if you re just get into the band metallica s sophomore album ride the lightning certainly showcases some interest and classic thrashers it s hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album it seem that this album seem to be an overlook one in metallica s early catalogue consider kill em all be generally consider the birth of thrash metal master of puppets be regard as metallica s magnum opus and and justice for all get metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for one regardless of whether or not ride the lightning be overlook or not it s still a classic that should be in every metalhead s collection one interest thing about this album be that while it still capture the raw power and fast energy of metallica s debut it seem to have a thick more polish and at time more epic sound don t get me wrong though i still think the four horsemen off their debut be one of the fine metal epics but to get a full review of ride the lightning simply read on fight fire with fire start things off with some classical acoustic guitar play for a bite over half a minute suddenly a crush riff rip its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour the massive drum crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare the sing be also very raw with jam sing a very staccato pattern do un to others as they ve do to you great way to start off the album ride the lightning the six and a half minute epic title track start off with some high pitch guitar note before go into a thrashy devil s tritone riff some epic guitar solo be feature in here along with an interest storyline that show how the band be against capital punishment for whom the bell toll be a progressive five minute classic with plenty of great guitar riff that occupy the first two minutes of the song the nasty riff of them all be feature in the chorus and some wild guitar play close this war song out fade to black be a personal favorite of mine one of the best songs on the album and one of the very best songs metallica s ever write some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work open with a lovely electric solo mournful but poetic lyric occupy the verse then come a powerful chorus riff more great guitar solo fill the rest of the song out trap under ice be another heavy song about struggle feature some dirty riffage and wild solo that definitely make itself worthy to be on the album escape be a more melodic radio friendly sound song but nonetheless a great track as well a bite short and a pretty cool song creep death be a song that define thrash metal this be an overall great song that you gotta hear its lyric refer to the seven plague in the story of moses in the bible and the thrash riff pummel their way into your brain and as always kirk hammett show us why he s an amaze guitarist when he screech out those awesome guitar solo the call of ktulu be a nine minute progressive instrumental a cool way to end the album it have an odd but mesmerize tone that feature some mighty and powerful riff and drum alongside solo that give the song quite an epic tone i personally prefer orion off master of puppets but this song be definitely a great one too so as you can see ride the lightning be undoubtedly a classic metal album i ve see it rank as be one of the top ten metal albums of all time and when you give this a listen you ll see why all of the track be very strong the songwriting s great as be the sing guitar bass and drum play get this along with the other three metallica release in the 80s and even the black album if you re interest overall this be a very strong and solid album that i would recommend to all fan of thrash metal and heavy metal in general good job to the tallica guy thank for the time and peace this just get good every year fade to black trap under ice just 2 reason to have this cd no metal fan in the world should be without this this album be also theme in a way all the songs be about ways of die fight fire with fire nuclear war ride the lightning electrocution for whom the bell toll on the battlefield fade to black suicide trap under ice drown escape difficult to explain listen and make your mind up about it creep death murder all these songs be classics with great big crunchy guitar riff thick heavy drum powerful bass and to top it off great lyric 4 star for what it be in the history of metal 3 star for how it now compare to what it be back in the day in short when this come out head turn and then bang hard seem miraculously heavy at the time but of course this look like romper room now after band like carcass etc none of whom do much for me after a tune or two i love true heaviness which come to my ears from extreme tightness between the drummer bassist kickdrum and bass lock in tight over the riff specifically and guitars here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer but lars and jam be only half of this band kirk be way overrate as a lead player very prosaic and uninspired miles from someone like randy rhoads and man after the decades of cliff worship this album prove that legend be often myth the bass play here be merely average truly there be dozens of heavy and tight bassists cliff may have be a party monster and add to the vibe that way but his play be average geddy geezer harris etc etc etc blow him off the map that say there be some fast and furious highlight here but frankly everything be so on top of or ahead of the beat that it get wear after a few tune about one minute into bell toll be a highlight because everybody lock in but the guitars be finally a bite back in the pocket and everything get much heavy and fat due to that that s why the black album hit so hard producer rock know how to make their groove much fat and get them focus on melody as well as heaviness the black be too poppy to be real metal but be good for what it be as be this but neither be as good as puppets which have their most intense moments this be a great thrash album but that genre get real old if you want music as well as power but if power and release be all you want this will do it for you but if you really want that go to the various freeeee metallica tape trade sit and get the live show from this and late periods that s where the real heaviness lay funny that the best stuff be free ain t it who say life be always unfair metallica be boldly and appropriately name as it s virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the heavy metal genre without any mention be make about the vast impact that this band have make over the 80s and up to the mid 90s they lift up the genre from mindless juvenile topics of wild sex drug and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth what u2 do for pop rock metallica do for metal in blend intelligent topics with very very good musicianship and hence make the genre more accessible to a much wide audience than ever before in do so they extend the life of metal and ensure an audience at a time when people be more interest in synth pop ala eurythmics depeche mode howard jones etc metal owe a great debt to this band for ensure the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it be to this day this version of the 1984 album come in a mini lp replica sleeve mlps design which be very very well execute and be one of the best that i ve ever see the gatefold sleeve be make from very good quality thick cardboard and assemble so well that you don t fear it come apart easily once the glue start to get old also include be a 12 page booklet with all the lyric in japanese for the english ones you ll need a good magnify glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicate the original lp design unfortunately the sound quality be the same as it be in the original release and hence have not be remastered although good by 1980s standards the quality be not as good as what we have become use to with all the release that have be well remastered these days for this reason although the content be very good i cannot give this version 5 star as it s hard to justify the value proposition here as you be effectively pay for the mlps design only if you already have the album i suppose if you don t already have this or if you be a big fan of well design and execute mlps sleeves then you may be tempt to cough up the mulah for this if the sound have be remastered and hence improve over the original cd i would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 star and to recommend that you part with your hard earn dough for this with for whom the bell toll and fade to black you be get two of metallica s best ever track here and again contentwise you can t fault this album but you ll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album be worthy of the upgrade after the blister debut metallica delve further into their psyche further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet update nwobhm muse and it s a more difficult metal experience in general the songs on the debut cut with a sharp knife whereas the number here tend to pound through only after repeat hammer with a blunt instrument fight fire with fire be perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and be the perfectly think out album opener after that however the differences start seep in ride the lightning itself clock in at over six minutes and i m not sure it need it for whom the bell toll redeem everything however with it s excellent musical and lyrical assault the production value on this album seem a little dull the production credit go to metallica and perhaps that s the reason why the album always sound to me like it be blast away at me from behind a close door but the mental imagery the band be play with on the debut be expand on this release the very essence of metal lie within the sinews of songs such as trap under ice creep death and the swirl rob of the apparition that be the call of ktulu and the literary reference be a nice touch speak as someone who have regularly have to defend metal to his friends hey we ve all be there it s refresh to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem and the more educate aspects of it all up i would not recommend this for the total metal novice there be other more accessable slabs of metal out there but i would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who want to explore the early stuff in fact i d recommend that all hard rock and metal fan accumulate every album this band do from it s debut kill em all through to the black album if for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regard the hard end of the music spectrum ride the lightning be the one metallica album that seriously have a lot of aggressive power and remain a classic to this day while i m not particularly thrill with a few moments here and there overall it s much good than what many of the metal band in the mid 80 s be do with all their big hair constant party and chicks metallica s music remain fresh and excite all these years late this album be really underrate back in the mid 80 s people back then didn t know how to approach something with this much speed and punch fight fire with fire a plod guitar riff and the idea for an acoustic intro be rip off from a couple old black sabbath tune the verse melody be horrible but the chorus be decent ride the lightning the best part of the song be the 15 second guitar intro i love that great chorus as well that remain memorable no matter how many time it s play great guitar solo as well some part of the solo remind me of the mid 70 s rainbow song call light in the black for whom the bell toll let s just call it the way it be this be a classic metal track in the same way iron man be black sabbath s classic fade to black a soft number that gradually build into a much heavy and typical metallica track it s not really a ballad it s a shame the verse melody have be copy time and time again by metallica themselves as early as their black album in the early 90 s the original idea be right here on this album the lyric don t sound very emotionally honest though i like the second half of the song more even though part of the guitar solo sound rip off from black sabbath s snowblind trap under ice flashy guitar play that sound like a leftover from the kill em all album not that that s a bad thing mind you escape really good song though the chorus sound stick in the 80 s with that date sound i like the way the verse melody chug along great lyric by their standards too creep death another memorable heavy speed metal track these guy be clearly more talented than most the guitar solo sure sound like it be copy from a popular scorpions song at the time call of ktulu a very slow rock build up it s really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people you need to have at least one metallica album in your collection and none of them be good than this one get it ride the lighten metallica s second album be notable for its musical direction

subtetlies and flourish that metallica would late use to adorn their music with instead the focus be to play the music as loud and as fast as humanly possible they sound rather like their

in which metallica really come into their own while kill em all have some very strong songwriting they don t display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record all over we see metallica open their sound up fire with fire the soft intro to battery from master feel like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the open track fire for fire after the mellow intro the band kick the song into high gear this shift be clear evidence the band be master different dynamics and integrate shift tempos into a coherent song structure and they re not just brutally fast like kill em all ride the lighten be one of metallica s more epic compositions lyrically the song set up theme of be powerless in a hostile situation a theme hetfield would often return too for whom the bell toll deal with the futility of war another theme the and would revisit on both master and justice and be title after the earnest hemingway novel one of the band s more famous early songs the intro be pretty long at over two minutes before hetfield start sing fade to black be notable as it be the first ballad ever commercially release by the band just because they be label sell out during the load era doesn t mean it diddn t happen fore then those people who hate load and reload should take note that accusations that metallica sell out first surface with this very song due to how much of a departure this be for the band s clearly establish sound now however most fan and critics as well as the band itself consider this one of metallica s great songs the song be very much a study in dynamics and while it be primarily a slow ballad metallica work in some heavy passages in the song as well the song deal mainly with death and be consider a suicide classic this be one of metallica s most important songs as it show the band s fan base there be a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash trap under ice have some killer chorus work and interest lyric musically it s very solid as well the song have some absolutely intense guitar work probably the second weak song though next to escape metallica have only perform the song four time live escape be one of the few songs the band have never play live write as filler because they didn t have enough songs for the album the band have pretty much disavow the song while i don t know why the band hat it that much it be true that this be easily the weak song on the entire album though not necessarily bad par se it s just the other songs be that good creep death write from the point of view of the angel of death come to kill all the first bear in egypt remain one of the band s principal early epics and be still one of their most frequently play songs draw their inspiration from the movie the tend commandments cliff burton make the observation that the plague of the first bear be like creep death and the band want to use it for a title they like it so much one of the band s most famous of their early songs this one s an undeniable thrash classic and last but definitely not least be the call of ktula the second instrumental release by the band after anethestia pull teeth from kill em all this be the last song primarily write by david mustaine of megadeath fame that metallica would record originally entitle when hell freeze over cliff burton have the song rename because he be a h p lovecraft fan and be reference the call of cthulhu megadeath actually use the chord for their song hanger 18 discount the two cover tuesday s go and mercyful fate it s the band s fourth long record and the long song on ride the lighten for my money this be one of my favorite metallica songs and when i really start listen to this album in the late 1990s this be the song i would play over and over it s much good than master s instrumental orion absolutely brilliant even if mustaine do write it overall this be the album that would set metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s this be the album they become truly progressive if it weren t for escape this could arguably be one of their top albums as it stand this be still one of metallica s best record just only slightly flaw for the inclusion of escape and it s important that while hair metal and spandex be give metal a bad name band like metallica and iron maiden be still keep the hardcore music close to its root hair metal and glam pop be rather date it s too metallica s credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren t date at all give they be record in that same era of def leppard poison damn brett michaels ratt slaughter warrant stryper europe journey and other rather ridiculous band be do commercial hair metal and power ballads this be only metallica s 2nd album but already they be turn into a great think man s heavy metal sometimes i like to think this be metallica s debut because this be really the first album where they become metallica many early fan bemoan metallica s late albums want them to return to the days of thrash metal with kill em all their weak album in my opinion they say they sell out by use slow tempos and multi instrumentation like pedal steel guitars and hurdy gurdy the reality be that metallica have always be ambitious and here on their 2nd album they prove in conclusively this be a fantastic album one that have really stand the test of time it be make over 20 years ago and still sound fresh today it be load with classic metallica track the thrash opener fight fire with fire the fantastic title track the brilliant for whom the bell toll the magisterial signature track fade to black another majestic signature track in creep death one of my all time favorites and the brilliant prog influence instrumental that close the album the call of ktulu it be also interest to note that kirk hammett have a much large role on this album he co write many of the songs and his lead guitar doesn t seem throw in like it do on kill em all this be one of my favorite metallica albums it s the 2nd step in a discography that just keep get good metallica s second album and their first for a major record label elektra entitle ride the lightning be also arguably their best album ever first release in august of 1984 ride the lightning be consider a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release after the promise debut album kill em all in 1983 metallica which be comprise of singer guitarist jam hetfield lead guitarist kirk hammett drummer lars ulrich and the late great bass player cliff burton the band s cult follow get them a major record deal with elektra record and the band go to denmark with the band themselves produce and use one time rainbow engineer flemming rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which i find to be the case when i first get this album in may of 1989 on cassette the album start off with fight fire with fire which at first sound like it be go to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars play a relax melody but then hammett and hetfield s guitars come scream in as be ulrich s drum which sound like bruce lee on speed and burton s bass play which be superb jam vocals on the track sound sinister we continue the rock on the album s classic title cut which be a classic thrashy cut with tempo change that would make the prog rockers happy next be another classic metal track for whom the bell toll which be a superb rocker with a beat that sound like march off to war the first half end with fade to black which for the most part be a ballad before speed up and be imho the stairway to heaven of the 80s as like that song start soft then pick up then soften then get hard and hard before the big finale the album s second half kick off with a classic thrash number call trap under ice which be just superb next be another great metal number escape however it s a shame that these two great songs be overlook by many we then come to one of metallica s best pre 1991 masterworks creep death which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song be amaze we end the album with the epic instrumental call the call of ktulu which sound like the band have be listen to elp genesis pink floyd and yes as the piece be fill with tempo change key change and be just stellar especially hammett and burton s solo on guitar and wah wah bass respectively while ride the lightning scrap the top 100 upon its release without either radio or mtv or even mainstream media support the album today be now their third large sell album with some five million copy sell in the us alone today most metallica fan from 1991 onward probably don t like this album but us purists who like their speed metal sound in their early days then this album be for you highly recommend there be many agruements of what the best metallica album be i have to say that ride the lightning be easily their best effort and might be one of the top 10 metal record ever make every single song on this cd be a perfect 10 and every single tune be heavy as hell except for call of the katula but it do some crunch at the end there be no way that metallica will ever give us a release like this again true the master of puppets be great to but i don t think it quite measure up to ride the lightning master have really be wear out since i listen to it soooo much that it really doesnt do it for me anymore i still love ride the lightning as they day i buy it in 1986 enjoy the division between kill em all and ride the lightning be huge the albums sound like two different band amaze where kea be juvenile and garage bandish ride the lightning be the polish effort don t get me wrong a lot of great songs come from kea but ride the lightning be good fight fire with fire open up the album back when it be an actual album and never look back absolute pure shred ride the lightning creep death fade to black for whom the bell toll all classics their first really professional effort for electra with the final batch of dave mustaine co write tune clearly one of the great metal albums of all time dig it metallica once bring up into a conversation two things pop into a man mind one of a historically important thrash band that make an impact upon almost anybody who care to listen and a historically important band that practically change their name to nutallica and also practically sell their souls for money both of these be true but the first be so fresh and original and important that to this very day we still love these songs the true metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best although there be only 8 songs here they be all of a decently long length and be all so beautiful that you never want them to end this be metallica not the metallica of today with 6 minute songs contain stupid lyric a trash can and no solo after the black album pay no attention to them you ll only be disappoint but back to this album kill em all be the begin of metallica and here on their second album they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of hit the light or whiplash great songs but not important lyrically speak almost all of these songs be about death not death in the sense of cannibal corpse s hammer smash face but more so in that that each be about a different issue and make a point and have something important to say with a short break down i ll show what i mean 1 fight fire with fire 10 10 one of the best and fast metallica songs in my opinion this one be about nuclear warfare 2 ride the lightning 10 10 beautiful solo a song that you ll be happy to have stick in your head this one be about the electric chair 3 for whom the bell toll 10 10 slow but one of the most important track here it s about the spanish civil war and also have something to do with h p lovecraft an author whom kirk have a fascination with 4 fade to black 9 10 a friend of mine find this to be relatively bore in my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song but when you be in the mood this song rock it be about suicide and from what i understand this song be also controversial because a man kill himself while listen to it back in the 80 s 5 trap under ice 8 10 great song the solo be great the atmosphere be great it s about well be trap under ice 6 escape 8 10 the only song not about death more so about escape from a town that want you to be a certain way and therefore rebel remember 8 10 still mean good it s just that track 1 4 be classics 7 creep death 9 10 it s tell through the eye of the grim reaper an all around great song i love the middle part 8 the call of ktulu 10 10 a beautiful instrumental once again about an h p lovecraft story i actually read this one and it s a good read very strange in my opinion this be far good than orion from master of puppets but that s just my opinion there be something about ride the lightning that i can not explain with any other record it have this strange dusty feel to it when glance at a copy of it it appear to be rather old and unused even a brand new copy pop it into a cd player the production have this weird dusty feel to it that have the same feel but when listen to it it seem like a gem or relic that one have discover in the attic of an old house it have this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicate or understand really jam s voice also have a rough edge to it as well that isn t on other metallica record this be my favorite metallica record as i can listen to it from start to finish and never become bore at all anyone who like metal should have some metallica in their collection i don t consider them to be the best metal band in history as a matter of fact i don t give that title to any band but this be a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash metallica be once great people listen to metallica for those beautiful solo for the touch and fun lyric and song mean but if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because lars be easily disposable and i could name insert any number here of drummers that be good than him lars just do enough to get by but he ll still have his moments of talent though in this present day i don t think there be a single person who doesn t want to just punch him in the face well enough about this album just find it get it in your collection and enjoy hop this help metallica s second album 1984 s ride the lightning be the first real metal album i ever buy when i buy it i be look for a really heavy album so when the first track begin with an acoustic intro i be sorely disappoint luckily however i skip to the next song the title track and its boom intro bring a big smile to my face ah nostalgia with 1983 s kill em all metallica help create thrash metal but they follow up their debut with their sophomore album which be release only a year late most metalheads have give it the credit it deserve but i feel ride the lightning be still somewhat underrate since the album that follow this one be master of puppets ride the lightning be still fast most of it shoot by like well lightning but it s slow dark heavy and more mature than kill em all jam voice be somewhat low than it be and his lyric be improve as the above amazon editorial review mention jam discuss several different ways to die armageddon capitol punishment suicide be trap under ice etc fight fire with fire have the aforementioned acoustic intro but it s just a tease it doesn t last the power chord fade in and the song become a breakneck speed with rip roar almost slayer esque guitar work lyrically this songs seem to be about the apocalypse ride the lightning be the album s most popular single it s another thrashy number with boom rhythms fiery chug and churn riff which go from fast to fast to slow to fast and an awesome lengthy hammett solo ride the lightning have good lyric about be execute by the electric chair and it also have a surprise end but most of this song be an instrumental for whom the bell toll be slow pace but still loud and heavy the first two minutes of this song be an instrumental begin with a bell ring then the heavy repetitive churn guitars kick in this song have another good wind solo near the end fade to black be really morbid because it have depress introspective lyric about suicide it begin with a distant guitar solo but the acoustic strum actually make the first part of this song rather pretty pretty in a dark and depress way but pretty nonetheless the chorus still have heavy riff and the end be an ascend and cascade solo trap under ice be very fast pace with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle escape have vocals which make it radio ready it have good vocal hook most of the song have propulsive riff with thunderous drum but the chorus be slow creep death begin with machine gun guitars and drum before change to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead and of course there s another stellar solo near the end the call of ktulu be the album s instrumental in my opinion this song be as great as orion from metallica s next album master of puppets and it s a very good way to end the album it start out slowly and ominously with wind woosh but then it suddenly become a lot fast this song build well and have superb guitar and drum work so this disc be another wonderful landmark album and it s still one of the best c d s of the past two decades all of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album be here long songs about 6 minutes per song rapid fire riff rip solo an instrumental track and even some acoustic guitar lick in conclusion if you want a complete metal collection or if you just like heavy metal you need this album more than you need your next breath in 1984 metallica have release their sophmore album entitle ride the lightning this album turn out to be even good than kill em all this album be definite in prove metallica to be the best heavy metal act out there this album have all the sound you could ever want from a heavy metal band fight fire with fire this song be just astonish any self respect metallica fan would love this song i sure as hell love this song ride the lightning ah the album s incredible title track can t get enough of this song and it sure can t get any good than this for whom the bell toll when i say it couldn t get any good than ride the lightning i be wrong this album just keep get good especially on this tune damn this frigging guy can rock fade to black this song be my favorite off of the album all i do be listen to this song a first time then i start again for an encore presentation if you listen carefully you ll notice the song be talk about suicide gotta love this song trap under ice incredible escape a great song with great lyric and a rockin sound creep death as much as i love hear this one it creep me out because of the title but i can t help it when i just sing along with jam on this one the call of ktulu instrumental song what an album these guy know what fan want in a heavy metal album this band be definitely go to be here for a long a time so get up off your a and buy this album if you don t have it already this be metallica s second album ride the light which be release in 1984 although it s not as good as master of puppets but it s still a classic gem pick up where their debut album kill em all leave off ride the lightning have good production the open track fight fire with fire start off with a little accoustic intro and suddenly warp into thrash speed and will have you headbanging throughout the title cut be another menace headbanging track as well for whom the bell toll and the awesome thrash ballad fade to black be two of the band s most popular songs creep death be another great song and of course the close track the call of ktulu be an epic instrumental jam hetfield s vocals be good and his rhythm guitarwork be good as well kirk hammet s lead guitarwork be splendid cliff burton s bass line be very menace and lars ulrich s drum be good as well anyways this be a great album and should be a part of your collection buy it now r i p cliff burton themetalbeast s rat 1 fight fire with fire 5 5 2 ride the lightning 5 5 3 for whom the bell toll 5 5 4 fade to black 5 5 5 trap under ice 4 5 6 escape 4 5 7 creep death 5 5 8 the call of ktulu 5 5 be it me or be just about everything a lot cool in the past for instance back in the 80s metallica be know for pound crush headbanging metal and now they re know for rip fan off and like money it s a sad state of affairs but i digress ride the lightning be easily one of the most awesome headbanging and skilled metal albums ever record it rightfully earn its place in every metalhead s favorite album list insane drum loud riff blister solo and actual melody work into the mix once again this be metallica from the intense apocolyptic opener fight fire with fire to the epic for whom the bell toll the beautifully write semi ballad fade to black and of course the metal classic creep death this album grab a hold of the listener and never let go throughout the whole album anyway yeah this one s a classic buy it and steer clear of emo if metallica s 1983 kill em all write the book on thrash metal then their sophomore release ride the lightning re write the book on what metal be capable of it be simply revolutionary at the time since kill em all the members of metallica have seriously expand their talents technique and their approach with this groundbreaker every track offer something new and experimental the instrument aren t the only improvement hetfield s lyric be much more personal and conscious the extend instrument arrangements blow everything from kill em all out of the water track such as fade to black and the call of ktulu be absolutely phenomenal work untouched by the standards of 1984 and although it s up for debate hammett s guitar solo be my favorite on this album check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on ride the lightning that leave my body cover with goose bump as a teen and still do to this day other highlight include fight fire with fire and for whom the bell toll this album rock in epic proportion overall metallica rule the world at this point in time there be no limit to their re invention of raw hardcore thrash metal i be a huge metallica fan grow up and this one get spin the most this be a absolute must have for anyone that claim they be a metallica fan the 2nd album from metallica be another heavy metal masterpiece and it s quite possibly even more entertain than kill em all among the highlight of the cd be trap under ice the call of ktulu fight fire with fire and for whom the bell toll between the monstrous guitar riff amd jam hetfield s intense vocals i just can t get enough of it for metalhads this be nonstop excitement others shouldn t even check this out this be one of metallica s pure best classic songs good lyric adrenaline and youth the band be really come together with this one no mtv to sell to little real radio support this be the boys pound out some of their best songs some of them be a little rough around the edge production quality and musicianship reach its best with the next album but this one be very good metallica s ride the lightning be a great cd it be tie foe my favorite metallica cd the best four songs on the cd be ride the lightning fade to black for whom the bell toll and creep death my favorite two songs from those four be creep death and ride the lightning the other four songs be still very good overall ride the lightning be a great cd and one of the best of metallica this album be just plain good and very well worth own ride the lightning be not as raw or fast as kill em all be but its heavy and the production be good it s a step up from their previous album go out and buy this today ride the lightning be one of the best albums of the thrash speed metal genre and along with their next album master of puppets be metallica s best work while their first album kill em all rely more on speed metal ride the lightning show the band expand their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities which would lead to their breakthrough in america every track here be very strong with many of them become metal classics the band write some of their best lyric here as many of the track deal with personal issue such as drug death and the struggle within there be much diversity to be find here whether it s the excellent speed metal of fight fire with fire and trap under ice or the long epics the call of ktulu the title track and the awesome creep death the menace for whom the bell toll and escape be also very strong track then there s fade to black the best track the band have ever record and be to heavy metal what stairway to heaven be to classic rock this be simply an incredible song between its several different movements and its lyric which tell of a man contemplate suicide the guitar solo from kirk hammett during the song s outro be one of the best ever of the genre simply one of the best albums ever record in heavy metal highly recommend although many people say that the black album or master of puppets be metallica s best albums don t get me wrong they re great albums and they re in the 5 star worthy material but ride the lightning be my favorite metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album i think that 5 star be not enough for ride the lightning i easily give this album an 11 fight fire with fire start off with a soft intro and it turn into a thrash metalhead s heaven and it s a killer song and i love the explosion at the end of the song 10 10 ride the lightning be the title track and it s another metallica classic although it isn t nearly as fast as the previous song but it s worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead s mind 8 10 for whom the bell toll start off with the toll bell and although i didn t think much for this song at first but the chorus line help me like this song and the toll bell be awesome 10 10 fade to black be a bite slow and soft than the previous songs they ve do but metallica can do a slow song very well that be up until they re load stuff and the loud guitar s somewhat remind me of black sabbath s iron man which be also a classic and there be more songs to come that have the same vein as fade to black 10 10 trap under ice be probably my least favorite song off of this album but it s still a good song especially compare to their post black album era 7 10 escape be probably the most underrate song off of this album and i actually like this song alot and i wish that the same thing can be say with the other metallica fan 9 10 creep death be another standout for this album and it s one of their heavy songs off of this album 10 10 the call of ktulu be the close track and believe it or not i actually didn t think much for this song but i give it a few listen and now this be my favorite song off of this album and i could listen to this song like 5 time in a row and never get tire of it ride the lightning be worth it for the price of this song alone and this song be easily one of heavy metal s best instrumentals of all time 10 10 if you never hear of anything that metallica have do before the black album then you re go to be in for a total surprise and this be the way how metallica first start if you like the late metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they be total thrash but the best of both worlds metallica be now the mtv icons 8 songs 4 metal gods rag guitars and full on drum friends welcome to planet metallica old school style i use to listen to this album back in the second grade right before my step dad haul me off to school the songs really prepare me for another day

death this be one of my favorite metallica songs its why i buy this album a really great song 5 5 the call of ktulu this be a killer instrumental that dave mustain of megadeath write when he be in the band 4 5 so as you can tell this be a classic metallica album that you should not miss out on this be one of their best albums hand down do you remember when metallica use to rock i mean they still rock well sort of but do you remember when they use to rock if you don t i suggest you get ride the lightning not now but right now if you aren t convince check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer hiphopforlife me welcome to my review of metallica s second album ride the lightning before i start let me give you some background on the band average joe whoa hold on if your name be hiphopforlife what be you do review a metallica album hiphopforlife be patient homeboy yes i be black and the big lover of hip hop alive but i be no joke as far as hard rock and metal go since my taste range from tool love em dream theater very underrate creed very overrate limp bizkit testament nirvana pantera slayer korn and metallica my first album be and justice for all ten years ago anotheralbum you should pick up i be more than qualify to review this album now on to buisness ride the lightning be the second album from the artists formerly know as metallica while their first album kill em all be raw and off the wall as you can get the guy calm down somewhat calm down and create one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever and the scary part be that the album after this one master of puppets a legend in it s own time be good it start off with fight fire with fire arguably metallica s fast song ride the lightning be up next which brilliantly look into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair for whom the bell tool relax on the speed but crank up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player cliff burton fade to black be next which be metallica s attempt and sucess at a power ballad average joe hold on hiphop this have a ballad don t tell me that metallica s go barbra striesand or bad bon jovi on us hiphopforlife to quote one of my rap idols ice cube kill that noise they have not wimped out by any mean the wimping out will be in 7 years this be the second best metal ballad of all time sanitarium on master of puppets be of course number one it be excellently write and sing by jam hetfield the great metal vocalist of all time sorry ozzy trap under ice and escape be next and to be honest these two songs be just okay in my opinion which be why most people rank master of puppets high than ride the lightning they aren t horrible just okay but the pace definitely pick up with the next two songs do not skip them creep death expound on jam christian scientist upbringing with a story on how moses free the isrealites it have a great middle part which make the whole song worthwhile now it all come down to the final song the call of ktulu a superbly construct instrumental which showcases all four members of the band s talents especially the aforementioned cliff burton who wrap up his title of the great bass player of all time that s ride the lightning one of the most influential record from metal s most influential band i would advise you to pick this up yesterday if not sooner average joe thank hiphop you sell me you be the great reviewer ever and you dear reader will be sell as well on the past greatness of the band once know as metallica get ride the lightning as well as their whole 80 s catalog and the black album if you must contrary to just about everyone else say master of puppets be metallica s best album i have always felt ride the lightning be metallica s fine and my all time favorite album the album start off with fight fire with fire a song start with a classical acoustic guitar riff follow by an extreme pulse pound rhythm section courtesy of jam hetfield and lyric about the aftermath of nuclear warfare the title track deal with whats on the cover await execution in the electric chair the track also showcases lars ulrich s double bass drum for whom the bell toll one of metallica s most recognize songs showcases every band member s talents especially cliff burton s sonic bass assault up next be fade to black a haunt seven minute opus deal with suicide and this as well have become one of metallica s most popular songs the song have a special mean to me personally it be the first metallica song i have ever hear and it help me through some bad time trap under ice be about of all things be freeze suffocate under ice the lyric give a chill no pun intend feel to it and the song have a great chorus escape be hte only song that could be classify as filler material but it be a solid track in itself next up be creep death which be a concert staple to this day and contain biblical reference as lyric this be another song that showcases every bandmembers talents the final track the instrumental call of ktulu be very well do and we get to hear cliff s bass talents put to the test and we hear kirk hammett shine on guitar the only complaint i can even think of be that the album be too short and it leave you want more but that s not really much of a complaint all in all ride the lightning be one of the fine albums ever craft and the second of the first five metallica albums that be essential to every metal fan s collection i buy ride the lighten upon its release in 1984 when i be in 8th grade my friends practically laugh me out of school for like such junk motley crue and ratt be the real metal band back then well i never have be one to be affect by peer pressure so i stick to my gun by the time we graduate in 1988 everyone of those guy who make fun of me in junior high be metallica fan and they be the big metal band of the 80s here it be almost 20 years after its release and i still believe it be the best metal album ever make even though i fell out of the metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have be release since this be one of the best metal albums ever i think most would agree that master of puppets be good and i think i go against most people when i say that i prefer kill em all but still this be fantastic after release the killer and at the time original debut metallica they release an even good album fight fire with fire sound a bite cliched today with the quiet intro but it be one excellent song ride the lightning be another great song and for whom the bell toll be quite sludgy and very good they don t make riff like that anymore then come one of the best metallica songs ever fade to black this be a quiet song which build up progressively and be excellent trap under ice and escape be not so good but be listenable and they don t have me reach for the skip button creep death be another excellent metallica song and along with fade to black be one of the albums highlight then come the call of the ktulu this be probably the best metal instrumental i ve ever hear and to think that lars be the only member of the band who be over 20 at the time you win t find musical maturity like that in most band never mind that young and certainly no nu metal band will have it today this belong in any true metalheads collection there aren t many albums that be good than this i have the very original release of the lp on the metal indie megaforce release just before elektra here sign them and reissue the lp only a few months late make the megaforce original a collector s item just total kick s metal all the way the bonus cd could be jump in the fire but i aine sure on vertigo or sony japan it s like this baby metallica help define thrash metal in the 80s with kill em all they prove that they could play hard fast and with ream of energy however the subsequent release of ride the lightning prove to be a more think out collection of songs hetfield s peerless riff be more refine and his growl vocals be come along he still wasn t too great though hammett s solo be mostly excite and he become one of the most copy lead guitarists around in metal even ulrich whose drum be always relatively simple fit well with the music be give it a crush edge metallica have never be too focus on bass so i feel sorry for cliff burton he doesn t really get too much attention he still play an important role in add extra punch to the riff but one thing that s nice about metallica s new work be that the production be more accommodate to the different instrument just a small gripe anyway this album tell you what metallica be all about the highlight of ride the light one of my favorite metallica songs fade to black it s a great anti suicide song that start with slow lugubrious guitar that build up into heavy powerful riff it conclude with exhilarate punchy riff and a glisten solo fan have write to metallica say that this song deter them from take the course of suicide that s how good it be call of ktulu the big instrumental be almost symphonic in its interplay which be why it work so well with the orchestra on s m creep death and for whom the bell toll be heavy clomp thrash songs with interest progressions and killer riff fire fire with fire be mindless thrash with lot of kick trap under ice be tight speed metal ride the lightning isn t as ambitious or complex as metallica s follow up master of puppets or and justice for all however most of the songs be great one way or another here metallica drive by pure intensity and deliver a great great metal album the band jam hetfield lead vocals rhythm guitars kirk hammett lead guitars cliff burton bass guitars lars ulrich drum percussion the disc 1984 8 songs clock in at approximately 47 minutes include with the disc be a 6 page booklet with black white band picture song credit lyric and thank you s all music write by metallica record at sweet silence studios in copenhagen denmark label elecktra comment i grow up with this album play the vinyl record in college so many time i wear it out thank god for compact discs this be still a classic metallica album however decades late i go back and forth with ride the lightning think it totally shred one week and then the next week think it s so hard to get into this album take an acquire taste and perhaps mood be the good word lightning be metallica find their root sure 6 of the 8 track be fragment of brilliance atom split rapid fire assault on the sense the lightning quick songs be important in the band s library of songs they have to go through these early stag to get to where they be today so many years late the title track be perhaps my favorite fast track on the album the two slow songs for whom the bell toll and fade to black be perhaps two of the best songs in the entire metallica catalog i can still listen to these songs anywhere any time any day both feature some amaze guitar work both electric and acoustic call of ktulu be a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that i fell in love again with after their live version on s m simply blow me away decades after this release it s still a classic in my book but i have to be in the mood for it just a notch below master of puppets still a great disc right up until last year i be never really much of a metallica fan then for some reason i decide to get garage inc that in turn be follow by justice black load reload s m puppets and now ride before buy s m i decide to get the cunning stunt dvd and believe me i really enjoy the spectacular concert the guy perform particularly creep death probably the best song on the dvd for whom the bell toll and especially kill ride medley those performances along with the track on s m be what prompt me to buy this cd i be especially interest in hear the original versions of fight fire with fire and ride the lightning from the medley and let me tell you they be definitely killer the machine gun guitar and drum riff be probably what make this cd popular in the first place imho metallica help create speed thrash metal in the early mid 80 s not only do you get the killer riff but you also get the popular fade to black which be similar to one in that it start out really slow then gradually pick up speed before peak at a fast guitar solo and then you have the call of ktulu which be an excellent instrumental by itself however i prefer the s m version it sound so much good with the orchestra be a new metallica fan so to speak i can start to see why many of the longtime fan out there don t prefer the new stuff they ve put out i personally like both of the load ride along with puppets and justice be unique in the sense that jaymz and company have the gut to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day even though i ve hear it only a few time i m start to appreciate it already this be one of the best metallica albums behind only master of puppets and the self title black album for whom the bell toll and fade to black be two of their best songs and there isn t a bad one the songwriting be a huge leap over their debut with some of their best lyric not to mention countless classic riff and solo this be a must have',\n 'and the quality of queensryche s music have do just that promise land be a strange album for queensryche to release mostly because they have just enjoy mainstream success with the like of empire in contrast promise land be much dark more brood and certainly less mainstream arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever release and that s a good thing right well not necessarily the fact that this be bore just because it be dark do not make it really intelligent i respect the fact that they do what they want rather than lap up the commercial success like metallica do at the same time but that doesn t mean that everything they do be automatically brilliant because of it the fact be that this have hardly any decent songs to mention it lack the energy of warn and queensryche ep the accessiblity of empire and the brilliance of operation mindcrime it do have the wierdness of rage for order but in a bad way since it be resort to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of rage for order for an album that take 2 years to write and record queensryche don t have a lot to show for it it seem like they be go out of their way to be different rather than just let the music flow i give queensryche credit for try something different with this album clearly the music scene have change immensely from their previous smash hit release empire and yet queensryche go be a direction of their own not follow the trend of the time and yet this effort fall a bite flat in my estimation maybe i be just like others who be fan of empire and the epic operation mindcrime and shouldn t expect the band to remain the same nonetheless the catchiness of previous efforts be clearly lack the song disconnect which actually do make it to rock radio for a brief stint sum up this album perfectly for me the first single release i be i be one of the good track after amaze albuns operation mindcrime and empire this be a disapointment for me bore at the extreme overproduce it clearly show that the band be already lose their creativity vein queensryche have evolve considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific career they ve go from fiery heavy metal in the days of their ep to the lush rock opera of operation mindcrime to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful empire to their current status as a generic rock band in the middle of these last two phase come promise land compare to the remarkable accessibility of empire promise land be a little more difficult to appreciate live up to the amaze success and quality of empire be nearly impossible and i do not envy promise land for what it try to do the problem lie in the fact that promise land s excellent songs be not as densely pack as those on empire most of the songs be good but not all the songs be excellent there be moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from level of excellence the superlative production alleviate some of the boredom associate with the passable track as do the thick wall of sound arrangements however intersperse amonst the middle piece be some of the best track they ve ever record include some of the fine lyric the acoustic balladry of bridge make for a lucrative single that deserve all its enjoin success the sad thoughtful out of mind the ominous lady jane and the hard rock trappings of disconnect be all great the true standouts be the stormy title track with those monstrous arrangements and the harrow tone and the move close someone else the latter be the most un ryche song they ve ever do consist only of piano and geoff tate s emotive vocals the memorable piano riff thoughtful lyric and tate s passion be what make this one special tate even strain on a note guess he s human after all without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness the production help a good queensryche almost a great one still it can t touch the monolithic status of mindcrime and empire in term of songcraft those albums be the band s best though not a true concept album like operation mindcrime promise land be an engage conceptual esque song cycle unify by simarily theme songs and myriad sound effect from the open collage of 9 28 be we get right into the story with i be i which along with the bridge be a minor album rock radio hit other standout track include out of mind the epic title track one more time and the personal move close track someone else which be make all the more poignant as it s arrangement consist solely of piano and geoff tate s world class vocals this be possibly the band s best set of lyric ever they be for the most part intensely personal move and at time uplift out of mind with it s convey of guilt and the sense of perspective it give you and the all too typical father son story in the bridge be the standouts in the lyrical department the music and overall arrangements be also the best and most dense that queensryche have ever put together though not their top album that honor still belings to mindcrime this be one of their most interest and certainly one of their best',\n 'a friend say i would love this band well it be good rock some nice songs but not too memorable i like tecnho nice beat good poetic lyric this wasn t quite that one of the best trip hop albums ever still terrific two decades late i like most of the songs but i find i can t listen to it over and over but great stuff to turn on in the background when i m work great songs oddly this album leave you in a state of highness and in a good way the beat along with the oddly transfix voice of the artist leave me want and need more just like a drug i purchase few complete cd s but this be one that i have to get most of the songs be really good and i love the smooth sound i m glad i ve be introduce to trip hop mezzanine be another masterpiece from massive attack this be just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life its either great in a party it s amaze the mix of reggae hip hop eletronic and rock be worderful on mezzanine a music masterpiece try blue line and protection too well do massive attack this be simply the best massive attack album if you only get one of their albums make it this one it s hard to explain the vibe of this album but it s very cool indeed more so than their other albums i guess i would say it s a real smart album with a solid set of cold embrace this massively influential trip hop unit s most mature construct to date can fizzle off slightly in overly pseudo cool but remain a must own for anyone interest in electronic music there aren t many trip hop albums i have buy over the years that have manage to sound fresh every time i throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my ipod massive attack s 1998 classic mezzanine be one of those few trip hop albums that still sound as fresh today as i first hear it almost ten years ago the music be a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beat seductive male and female vocals and a diverse mix of sample from band like the cure what i love about mezzanine so much be that the music be dark and sinister all the death black metal band in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as mezzanine be there be a terrify quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller the first two songs angel and risingon sound like they would be perfect score for my nightmares i can never get tire of listen to teardrop which feature elizabeth fraser on vocals the production be neither too slick or too gritty mezzanine be one of the few albums i can actually call flawless every song be a massive attack classic teardrop with the mesmerize vocals of liz fraser be the standout track unfortunately the rest doesn t quite measure up don t get me wrong mezzanine be a very listenable album something that work well play in the background at night some track work especially well for seductive exploit it s just that the rest of this album sound like second rate portishead this be one of my favorite trip hop albums the first four track be just amaze and have me repeat them over and over the songs respectively be angel risingson teardrop and inertia creep angel have a stark production feature point beat and a distort bassline that frame the vocal and a two minute flame out with rag guitars risingson be a dense dark sound song with a ton of dub throughout teardrop be an awesome song where they collabored with elizabeth fraser from cocteau twin inertia creep be a highlight with an atmospheric sound fuzz tone guitars and a wealth of effect the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world have ever see these songs be definately the highlight and the other songs be still good just not as good as these four in my opinion overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection massive attack be one of the first gasp of trip hop notice outside of bristol and sadly they will be one of the last it seem they be urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip hop they convey menace but not the sinister pangs of angst echo by trent reznor and tori amos during the same era they speak volumes without word and like paul oakenfold provoke an atmosphere although oakenfold reach for lofty heights while massive attack belong in the darken alleys and underground club through its incarnations massive attack have be an intellectual s house party in a 1930 s brownstone in chicago s wicker park rain on the windows of a high rise over l a and the smoke mud and confusion of a college rave mezzanine be complex both within the track and in the connective tissue between them it be dark on the bright side more a 4 a m flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort its power be in a balance of rhythm drive and deep seat anxiety that beg for further listen mezzanine be another classic album by the legendary group massive attack and i would even argue that it s good there aren t any bad songs and the best songs here be simply extraordinary the best track be the first four songs which deliver a 1 2 3 4 of such creative genius that it ll instantly make you a fan sometimes relax sometimes haunt and always groovy mezzanine deliver a worthwhile follow up to blue line that protection fail to be like blue line mezzanine feature several singers who be all very likable and charismatic blue line suffer from the track one love where the singer arguably kind of ruin the song the lyric aren t as memorable as on blue line though but you win t mind overall it s a much dark album than blue line as it occasionally blend metal and industrial music with their trip hop sound hip hop and probably casual music fan will love this album a word for the wise the rest of the album might take a bite before you realize how good it be anyways very highly recommend along with their first album blue line and portishead s portishead though this one isn t as good highlight include the entire album you ve hear their music in commercials and movies and may not have realize it i didn t until i pick this album up within the past six months of it blue line and 100th window only ones i have it s the best and that be clearly in consensus with other ma fan this be a very good album just really interest and exceptional musically if you re at all interest in this kind of music you cannot go wrong with mezzanine edit i ve actually be listen to this album more over the last 24 hours and be now of the opinion that it s more masterful than i originally think it s easily listenable from start to finish there be no weak songs if you think you ve find a weak song you ve just not listen to it enough yet this album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup be it high quality earphones or preferably a nice car stereo because some of its bass line be truly praiseworthy as others have allude to or state this be the kind of cd that hold a constant spot near the top of one s music collection i know it be good but only now do i fully understand that fact isn t it a breath of fresh air when a single album be full of such greatness and not just one or two songs as with 99 of the music out there it be say that imitation be the best form of flattery if this be true the fact that several years after its release the open angel continue to appear on original soundtracks should speak volumes from the first chord the third album by the band that bring trip hop to us along with portishead and morcheeba be yet another classic at several point it feel like a precedent to some of the chillout act to come in late years remember this be release in 1998 with a tight bass sound stream from song to song a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all this album lack nothing and raise the bar above their previous protection where the main thing i miss be the participation of everything but the girl s vocalist tracy horn think no more and get it i don t know too much about their other albums but i can t imagine any other be good than mezzanine you can call this trip hop or electronica if you want but this be just cool mood music that be beyond beautiful perfect for put on after the bar at home with that last drink or smoke of the night with guest vocals from the cocteau twin singer and a cool sample of the cure on track seven you know this be gonna be good teardrop be the big song from this and the rest be just as move it will go great with your portishead and sneaker pimp cd s i haven t be into massive attack for too long probably a couple of years now mezzanine be my very first ma album i buy it because i hear nothing but good things about this group as well as this album the rest be all history i have their other three albums blue line protection and 100th window i think of all the ma albums i own mezzanine resonate with me the most the music be dark and forebode lyrically and musically the cd start off with the dark sound of angel i particularly love that songs for the dark slow hip hop beat mix with the haunt vocals the choices in sample be astound if not refresh normally i loathe the use of sample but massive attack be able to use sample and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intend my personal favorite songs off mezzanine have to be man next door and teardrop those songs be simply amaze i recently put in mezzanine into my cd player for the first time in months and amazingly enough it still hold up very well in today s current music scene i really think that mezzanine set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music it be one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two mezzanine be one of my all time favourite albums it s just that good the arrangements the production and the wibe on the album it s dark and beautiful and the musicianship be also top notch the album have many guest appearences and the lads from massive be geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs teardrop be now a classic and many other songs be also brilliant i recomend everyone who claim to be a music fan to buy mezzanine it be indded one of the best albums of the late 90 s and probably of all time seductive spellbind there be probably many other word out there that can describe this record but the five i ve mention be probably the close that will match the feel i get from listen to it imagine a dark tranquil atmosphere with shimmer electronic music and bassline groove and narrative soulful vocals in the background mezzanine perfectly fit this description some of the highlight include angel where the music start soft and then build up into a scream frenzy or how about teardrop w former cocteau twin vocalist elizabeth fraser which feature an angelic voice an acoustic guitar and the same shimmer electronics i could go on and on but i think it s best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself if i m not mistake it be one of spin magazine s top 20 record of 1998 heck i buy it just before christmas last year and wonder what take me so long in do so in any case i ll definitely look into buy their other stuff include the dvd and i look forward to their new record which should be come out sometime this fall what strike me first after hear mezzanine be its sheer weight the sound with its low beat and in a first for massive attack thrash guitars succeed in actually oppress the listener and that s very much a good thing because the music in this album be just so very novel and smooth you want to feel every part of it as usual with massive release mezzanine feature the vocals of two female vocalists on several songs liz fraser formerly of cocteau twin and newcomer sara jay liz s contributions be some of the high point of the album and teardrop be just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998 sara jay s one song be the insidious and sneaky dissolve girl which have massive attack do some new trick with electronica horace andy the reggae singer who be a mainstay of massive attack s albums have three songs here the industrial angel and the almost retro massive attack man next door and exchange the songs feature the vocals of massive s members 3d and daddy g be also well do and 3d s threaten whisper on risingson do a lot to make it one of my favourite songs although certainly some of the songs be good than others this be one of the few cd s i ve ever listen to where there be not a single bad song the album as a whole be perfect and i would recommend this to any person who be breathe and have a pulse',\n 'i remember when this come out on lp in the early 70 s thank god it have be re issue on cd this be what philly sould be all about the stylistics make moody soul music atmospheric there s also a hint of warrick bacharach in their music well after all they do cover you ll never get to if you break my heart and the joyous make it last carry on in that vein other than that song in my opinion this album doesn t really get go until the second half the jazzy slow burn of love come easy the off hand rock n roll title track the soul classic you make me feel brand new and the exuberant i win t give you up but the highlight for me be undoubtedly there s no reason with it s off kilter melody interest arrangement and roll chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies along with most of the other songs the gentle understate sound add to the whole atmosphere songs like only for the children and could this be the end i don t know i ve always think russell thompkins jr be at his best sing love songs because it suit his vocal style than angry songs overall i would give this album a 7 or three and a half 1973 the philly wonder group stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums 2 straight classics thom bell and linda creed make a great production team and russel thompkins jr keep hit the high note as the lead tenor the music be lush again like the second album round 2 and there be some surefire winners here make it last have the same lushness of songs like you ll never get to heaven if you break my heart from round 2 payback be a dog be about how a woman who do wrong will finally know how it feel when she be on the receive side of the heartbreak and have impeccable harmony love come easy have that smooth lush feel again and deal with find one great thing in life in an uneasy world love rockin roll baby have a vintage 70 s rock feel with the great falsetto lead give it a soul inflection and a light touch of funk not my fav but it show that the stylistics can expand into different territory effectively a persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited be express in the nice mid tempo i win t give you up then we have a great jam with the slow let them work it out which be more laidback and deal with a certain friend who gossip about other friends love live and trouble in say romance and that it be get annoy the song be about let couple work through their difficulties a somber joint be could this be the end it be another slow joint with perfect harmony rockin roll baby be another classic in the stylistics catalogue thom bell be a genius musician especially consider his classic work with the delfonics the stylistics the spinners among others the stylistics be right next to the delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul group ever',\n 'i m a life long blue oyster cult fan from way back in 1988 they release imaginos 122 at the time i think this be a tremendous record but after 22 years of reflection it s a 4 star release at best this be a upgrade after club ninja but that wasn t very hard to do the thing about imaginos it have too many special guests and the record be 5 or 6 years in the make i didn t know that at the time i buy it in 88 i still like these songs after 22 years i be the one you warn me of les invisibles magna of illusion with some fine piano by allen lanier the remake of their own astronomy 9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune be the classic blue oyster cult just a great track buck and eric at there best ok it may have start out as a great concept album in the mind of sandy pearlman it may have grow into a joe bouchard solo album which stretch out over multiple record date it may have end up as the final boc album in 1988 because of the fact that joe bouchard be join in sessions by eric bloom allen lanier buck dharma and albert bouchard so what it s get the bone rattle truly unique the siege and investiture of baron von frankenstein s castle at weisseria feature joey cerisano and jon rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout chant refrain carpe diem follow by doomsday crash riff heavy guitars and the open track i be the one you warn me of which be easily as good as any of the track on the early boc albums there s also a remake of two songs from the second album tyranny mutation astronomy and subhuman which be retitled blue oyster cult here sometimes it pay to focus on what an album be as oppose to what it isn t this one will shake the fill loose from your teeth it may be a patchwork quilt but it rock like a mother and the fact that it s back on cd be worth celebrate back in the day boc be huge i love their music and get everything they ever put out except one imaginos i be overseas in the navy when it come and the 2 albums prior to this be a bite of a disappointment so when it come out i be busy and just didn t get around to get it when i do go to get it it be go pull from the shelve everywhere for what i don t know but nowhere to be find no big deal right i mean tha last 2 release be rather dull so i figure boc be tap out become nostalgic and nundane many years before i even express interest in it again after i hear from others that it be actually very good some of the best boc have ever do many say hmmmm good get it not everybody want like mega buck for a copy anyway when i saw it here re release i jump all over it damn glad i do when i first listen to this and keep in mind for 30 years i have never hear even one track from this cd it be like hear the late release form one of my favorite band and it rock as a whole i give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there be about 5 songs on this that be the best boc have ever do those songs get a solid 10 buck be blazingly fast and imaginitive ie the title imaginos these be blockbuster genious level guitar riff that prove once again that buck dharma be one of the great guitarists alive and way too many people have never hear of him a shame really boc have a dark inteligent perspective that always keep them to well cult follow status i be a member of that boc cult i like just hear this now because it truly feel new and fresh to me i know it come out in 1978 or 79 and it be now 2008 but you can yt tell that from hear this for the first time it sound like so much of boc s greates work classic and timeless if like me you be a boc fan and you don t have this you already know from the years that you gotta have it if you be a new boc fan or wonder if this be vinatge boc or just mediocrity from boc let me assure you this will top your collection as some of boc s fine and without a doubt buck dharma soundly place himself in the guitar god status like he wasn t there already kev an album that have always seem to divide boc fan imaginos be a concept album concoct by albert bouchard and sandy pearlman whose origins go almost back to the begin of the band two of the track on this album appear on secret treaties which serve as somewhat of a companion piece to imaginos the original boc lineup re unite for this one along with a host of guests the concept be the story of imaginos a time traveler of sort who appear at different time in the world s history to influence historical events the problem be that the story be not tell in a linear fashion and it end up be completely confuse i have read essay on the story behind the story and still haven t really figure it all out this be a weird album for me i think most of the songs on this disc be outstanding to the point of be some of the best stuff boc have ever do but look at the album as a whole it be not quite as good as i think it should have be be a big progressive rock fan maybe i set my expectations too high when i find out boc be do a true concept piece but on this one the sum be not great than it s part that be say there be some really great material here the remake of astronomy and blue oyster cult formerly the subhuman be good than the originals i be the one you warn me of les invisibles in the presence of another world del rios song the siege magna of illusion be all awesome the title track be a bite of a letdown but still ok still even with all this great stuff i think the album could have be put together good and re work to an extent anyway this be a minor quibble as this album really be a must for any fan of boc i believe it be currently out of print and hard to find this be an album the blue oyster cult fan will really get into a concept album that showcases the band unique song style for the casual listener or sometime boc fan stick with agents of fortune or fire of unknown origin imaginos be a heavy album and feature a great remake of astronomy the best song on the cd but unless you be prepare to invest some time decipher the story and songs you win t get much out of the album i pick up imaginos on cd after hear astronomy late at night the best time to play the cd and there be a narrative about the imaginos myth read by stephen king as the song open i hear this only two time on the radio and pick up the cd because i be a huge stephen king fan and enjoy some of boc s early albums needle to say the stephen king narrative be not on the album i be disappoint but play the disk a few time i enjoy i be the one you warn me of a pretty straight ahead rocker and in the presence of another world which be a more down tempo song actually most of the songs be good and you will find yourself hum the chorus for hours after listen the only track that i find lack be the title track imaginos for some reason most likely the background singers oooohhhh imaginos ooooohhh imaginos oooooohhhh ooooohhh ooohhhh imaginos the song sound like fanfare for a two bite magician about to perform in vegas or something once i get that image stick in my head i just keep picture imaginos the great perform card trick and turn newspaper into doves if you see a copy of this disk use for under 10 pick it up but i don t think it s worth the 20 use price i see here',\n 'classic one of his best albums great cd run out and buy this his first and one of his best albums other than the first marshal mathers lp in my opinion i want an album so rugged nobody could touch it eminem proclaim if hes refer to rap albums this lp might just be that ill say here and now with no hesitation or reservation that eminem be easily the best rapper ive ever hear no popular rapper you can think of alive or dead even come close i mightve be say the same about guest royce da 5 9 if he weren t upstage by a rapper whose comedic wit clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius there be very little filler in eminems verse even when hes lace them with unnecessary profanities the slim shady persona be a deviant white trash druggie who aim to offend almost every two bar be a quality set and many of those set be classic quotables unless hes cheat it somehow his creativity be close to amaze he even do his own sound effect the beat be also impressive so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty chorus and silly skits marcellee com this be an awesome cd it be fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd be track 2 my name be 3 guilty conscience 4 brain damage 6 if i have 9 role model 13 cum on everybody 14 rock bottom 15 just don t give a 18 i m shady 19 bad meet evil 20 still don t give a if you have not listen to this cd then i recommend you do before the slim shady lp a no name emcee name eminem be probably rip the mic at the lyricist lounge or other underground hiphop spot back when he be an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scar you sh less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battle ability back when he be able to step into a rhyme cypher with canibus mos def last emperor and chino xl and dominate to a hiphop standpoint by focus on his lyric and compare with his early efforts this cd be the begin of his downfall but with the variety of ideas it save the cd and by be so creative bring it up to 5 star unfortunately because he s not on a dependable label he s force to rap to garbage beat which be dre s specialty but this release be some of his good ones he s force to do exactly what the high level employees he work with say he s not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that have become of him have force him to listen to dre and others and rap about that instead of make his own ideas artist one that can use their imaginative ability to create something but none the less an excellent debut cd by a good artist who s stick with a bad label hopefully one day slim will wake up and leave dre in his footprints and join a true hiphop label rawkus plus he s not the only white rapper out there today evidence dilate people the high and mighty smut peddlers everlast whitey ford el p company flow and ra rugged man i m out mind power']"
