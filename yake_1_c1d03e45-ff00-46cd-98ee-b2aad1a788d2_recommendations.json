The album features 11 tracks from across Miles' catalogue from 1956 to 1981, select dialogue from the film featuring Cheadle in character, and five original compositions written, co-written, produced or performed exclusively for MILES AHEAD by Robert Glasper. These cues include &#34;What's Wrong with That?&#34; a jam that closes the movie imagining Cheadle as Miles playing in the present day with guest performers Glasper, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Gary Clark, Jr. and Esperanza Spalding; plus &#34;Gone 2015,&#34; an end-credits song featuring guest verses from rapper Pharoahe Monch. Cheadle also pens new liner notes for the album discussing the selection and creation of the songs on the soundtrack.\"],\"title\":\"Miles Ahead Soundtrack\",\"brand\":\"Miles Davis\",\"rank\":\"107,843 in CDs & Vinyl (\",\"asin\":\"B01BW5B29Y\",\"imageURLHighRes\":[\"https:\\/\\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\\/images\\/I\\/51z0SUFmlVL.jpg\"],\"details\":{\"Audio CD\":\"(April 1, 2016)\",\"Original Release Date:\":\"April 1, 2016\",\"Number of Discs:\":\"1\",\"Label:\":\"Sony Legacy\",\"Run Time:\":\"76 minutes\",\"ASIN:\":\"B01BW5B29Y\"}}]"}, {"asin": "B00Y0LB7OI", "explanations": [{"item_feature": ["solos"], "score": 1.337092874758051e-16, "users_matching_interest": ["solos"]}], "recommender_score": 1.8113482326134536, "item_metadata": "[{\"category\":[\"CDs & Vinyl\",\"Blues\"],\"description\":[\"CD\"],\"title\":\"Complete Recordings 1949-1962\",\"brand\":\"B.B.
